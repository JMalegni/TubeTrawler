"Destiny is failing due to the fact that most players who played through it are exhausted with the never ending DLC that GETS REMOVED FROM YOU. I quit playing when they removed the Mars DLC that I bought and paid for rather than realising their game had ran its course and instead worked on either Destiny 3 or a new game. No, they instead chose to milk it as a live service until the only community that&#39;s left is the toxic diehard fans who will never accept that bungie simply aren&#39;t the same company they once were or those who just enjoy spending over 200 dollars on a game that gets the content you buy removed after a few short years.<br><br>Let it die.",0,[]
