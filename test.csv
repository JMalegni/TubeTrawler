The description of electrons like passengers on a train is actually a surprisingly good one that also works for explaining stuff like the conductivity of metals and the photovoltaic effect.,0,[]
Graphics impeccable ,0,[]
Yo Mr Steve Taylor why are you so mean to the brown dwarves,0,[]
Maybe its not worth going into work tomorrow,0,[]
You should do a video on artificial intelligence,0,[]
The last thing to ever happen in the universe will be me getting a girlfriend. This is because it’s such an unlikely event that there just being a chance of it happening would cause the universe to collapse in on itself.,0,[]
One day brown dwarves will cry like baby yoda… or a busted can of biscuits.,0,[]
It took 6 years but we finally have a video that explains black dwarves.,0,[]
i hope theres a way for the universe to reset or im not playing &gt;:(,0,[]
"What a mind blowing video. And even in the end, after the end of time, they managed to put a beautiful animated ad.",0,[]
"The only thing that keeps me from totally believing this is the mere fact our universe was created, to begin with implies that it could happen again.",0,[]
a wonderful video by kuzrg,0,"['kurzgesagt', 'klutzge']"
"As always, my existential dread delivered right on time.",0,[]
"The end of time is always so fascinating. We don&#39;t have to worry about it of course, but I often wish to witness it with my own eyes. If we&#39;re talking about earth apocalypse however that&#39;s a different story.",0,[]
Everything dies. We live in the best time that has ever existed. Cherish it while it lasts!,0,[]
All speculation,0,[]
So my question is will a new universe begin or revive and we get another chance at life randomly ?,1,[]
I started watching your videos cause I found your book about the immune system in my local library and was in awe and in love. Please publish more books!,0,[]
Nearly every sentence in this video should be proceeded with ‘Our current understanding..’,0,[]
Amazing video! Tysm &lt;3,0,[]
but the matter and energy has to go somewhere tho?,0,[]
"I bet the next thing to happen after the &quot;last thing&quot; will be universe start to contract again: i.e The Greate Contraction, and everything repeats again.",0,[]
But where is all the energy released from black holes and explosions?  scattered throughout the universe? Maybe you can try to collect it somehow if a special facility and create special facilities that don&#39;t lose energy  because it reabsorbs it and we live inside the facility like a huge spaceship sheltering from the cold empty universe??,0,[]
Your telling me the length of the universe is longer than a googlplex,0,[]

where<br><br><br>where is the intro? :(,0,[]
Last thing to happen at last,0,[]
I don’t want my universe to die even if it’s forever away,1,[]

"Just before the end of the universe, Kurzgesagt will have to issue a video explaining why pocket universes are robbing mass from the greater main universe and this would jeopardise the Big Reset of the greater main universe. Kurzgesagt would then implore all viewers from pocket universes to return their stolen mass to make a better tomorrow. And also buy KurzMerch",0,[]

(eons?)  Imagine learning galactic timescale is so mind boggling long, only to be told that THIS makes that look like child&#39;s play!",1,[]
What about all the matter spread around with said supernova? Wouldn&#39;t gravity try to make something out of it? Combining all of that with all Black Dwarves Supernovas...,0,[]
I thought the end of the universe is the same as the start as the last black hole remaining will again explode result in a big bang like a reset and I Wonder how many times we have gone through this reset,1,[]
After millions of years Wouldn’t the super nova form new stars?,0,[]
So this is what a true immortal has to look forward huh... Neat.,0,[]
"if proton decay theory is proven right then this video is no relevant anymore, we will see....",0,[]
I wonder in the vastness of empty empty space that any violent reaction itself would be a different big bang.,0,[]
Do the animators of Kurzgesagt also utilize Procreate in creating these masterpieces?,1,[]
"I thought I understood the concept of entropy, and how the heat death of the universe is theoretically possible,if not the most probable conclusion, if they&#39;re correct, and that the end of the universe is a nearly simultaneous implosion &amp; explosion that no-being on the implosion side will ever see, but also creates a new light to a universe that has access to every element that ever existed, who&#39;s to say that isn&#39;t how this universe (or rather all universes) began...",0,[]
"Yes, yes. Heat death, cold death, brown dwarves, leaking black holes, theoretical black dwarves and nothingness. I can&#39;t wait til yet another science channel beats this topic to death ",1,[]
I find the heat death theory of the end of the universe to be quite a peaceful and fitting end to such a pulsing violent universe it was before it slowly just stops moving and gets empty and cold.,0,['The only source that got the start of the universe correct to which we got the big bang theory the bible says the universe will die by fire so... I bet one the one with the better track record lol.']
"I don&#39;t think the last black hole being destroyed rules out life entirely, there is the law of conservation of energy - it cannot be created or destroyed, the same goes for mass, a civilization that has lived that long surely would be advanced enough to convert mass into energy, or energy into mass with ease, or even be able to create their own small black holes which would basically be 100% efficient for turning mass into energy as it decays. They could develop things that would be nearly 100% efficient (or even exactly 100% as is seen today with removing frictional losses with superfluids or 99+% efficiency with creating heat) an advanced civilization would hardly waste any energy, and even if they did they&#39;d be able to convert it back.",1,[]
"If theres a life ending event on Earth, I would like to spend my remaing time with loved ones and the Kurzgesagt staff.",0,[]
Would it be possible for a civilization to use the black dwarves as fuel for nuclear energy?,0,[]

Hello,0,[]
And then what happens?,0,[]
It is not &quot;the last thing&quot;. There is a non-zero probability that anything happens. In the vast amount of infinity everything will happen - even the rebirth of the universe.,0,[]
What if the universe has life cycles and supernovas caused by supermassive black dwarves are big bangs,0,[]
People that have played Outer Wilds: &quot;Ok but will there be a banjo playing at the end?&quot;,0,[]
"You said that Black Holes, Neutron Stars, and Whites Dwarfs don’t let gas escape, right? But gas does escape from a Supernova. I almost wonder… if every black dwarf were to go off, would it be enough to begin life anew, creating a brand new cycle for life? If so, that could possibly explain how the Big Bang happened.",0,[]
Missed opportunity for a &#39;restaurant at the end of the universe&#39; reference,0,[]
I would reccommend &quot;a journey to the end of the universe&quot; by melody sheed if you somehow havnt seen it already,0,[]
What happened with entropi death?,0,[]
I guess what makes us able to be ok with death is knowing that when we are gone things will continue on after us.<br>The last person to die before this happens is going to be a sad person indeed.<br><br>That or we have literally every reason to find a cheat in quantum mechanics and make a real working 100% not a scam this time perpetual motion machine.<br>Then civilization lasts for a “Thomas’s infinity” which is like if you keep cutting the distance to your destination in half each time and never quite reach it but with a likelihood of reaching the goal going down instead of a distance going up.,0,[]
The duck trying to get a refund trillions of years after their purchase killed me ,0,[]
"But the black dwarves explosion, do they release materials/gas and could form stars again? Well even if they do itll prolly eventually run out of material again and finally complete nothingness occurs.",0,[]
Bunch of nonsense...,0,['Which part?']
Me getting girlfriend is the last thing,0,[]
I may not need to worry about it but it sure as hell is one of the bigger reasons I see having kids as a pointless cycle.,0,[]
Aren’t all of the bosons going to degenerate into objects with no rest mass?,0,[]
"I was about to write some comment that was something to the effect of &quot;it&#39;s crazy that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old, and the heat death of the universe is at least a few trillion years away&quot; and then something about how I felt that I had a good sense of large numbers, even for humans who are incapable of understanding exceptionally large numbers, and then  I remembered that 13.7 billion is 1.37% of 1 trillion... and not even four minutes into an 11-minute video the narrator is already talking about being well into the Quintillions, 10-more seconds Google Years with 10^100 zeroes, 20 more seconds we&#39;re talking about black dwarfs, like <b><i>Huh, bro, Time and Heat are CRAZY</i></b>",0,[]
Sounds more like another bigbang,0,[]
A video talking about the death of the universe and putting no Outer Wilds reference is criminal,0,[]
"considering the science behind this video, I think just saying oversimplification isn&#39;t even enough to describe it. It&#39;s an oversimplification of a simpplification.",0,[]
"In the far future a brown dwarf will kill us all, please keep this in mind.",0,[]
"Pretty cool how, if this is an accurate prediction, the universe will start and end with a bang",0,[]
So we’ll be dead longer than we didn’t exists before ,0,[]
"I had a nightmare one time when I was very young that felt very similar to being a black dwarf. I was aware that I existed but I had no ego. All I could experience in this dream was immense pressure from all around, and I felt like I was a super dense rock. Time was irrelevant and I felt stuck here for a long time. Quite an out of body experience for an 11 year old.",1,[]
"Now you need to make a space and time travel computer game, that is both educational and exploratory that uses AI to create adventures. lol",0,[]
This is just one interpretation of the end of all things. I take a Judeo-Christian interpretation from the scientific data we have regarding the universe.,0,[]
"I guess this is just a theory, I&#39;ve seen a lot of info that says the dark energy will keep separating things forever, even quarks, so the end will be different from this video. But it&#39;s the first time I hear about black dwarfs, this channel is amazing.",1,[]
how about a boltzmann brain Kurzgesagt? I’m pretty sure it is as interesting as a dead neutron star supernova.,0,[]
"I don&#39;t know what the last thing in the universe will be, but I do know there&#39;ll be SpongeBob music through the echoes.",0,[]
"If a black dwarf eventually goes supernova, wouldn&#39;t that release more materials into the universe, possibly allowing the creation of new planets or stars? I understand the impossibility of this due to the expansion of the universe causing all matter to gain distance rapidly, but lets say that wasn&#39;t an issue, could the universe theoretically restart itself?",0,[]
I love the existential dread these videos give me as i will most certainly be alive in over 1 googol years.,0,[]
1 or 2 photons will be the last thing,0,[]
I hope humans live that long to see all of that and great video kurzgesagt :],0,[]
This is only the last thing that ever happens if proton decay turns out to be false,0,[]
Kinda like the big bang..maybe we&#39;re just recycled every bazillion years,0,[]
"Nope ,the big crunch is next!",0,[]
“That was the last thing that will ever happen”<br><br>Cyclical universe theory: Are you sure about that?,0,[]
"Um ok, but if this is how it &quot;ends,&quot; that seems to imply there&#39;s only ever been one &quot;beginning,&quot; so how did that happen in an otherwise void and empty substrate of nothingness to begin with?",0,[]
The description of electrons like passengers on a train is actually a surprisingly good one that also works for explaining stuff like the conductivity of metals and the photovoltaic effect.,52,[]
why do they want to give us existential terror lol,0,[]
"...And even after all this there are still fluctuations occur in the so-called &quot;dead&quot; universe. The scientific confirmed theory is that in some given &quot;infinite&quot; time absolutely ANYTHING can happen. This will probably lead to one or two (or maybe both) results:<br><br>1. The Boltzman brain(s), that can realize its existence and be aware of itself. It can evolve into new lifeform and even be responsible for creation of a new universe.<br><br>2. A new inital singularity will ocure and emerge into the Big Bang 2.0, and you know what it means.<br><br>Even more, the authors don&#39;t mention anything about multiverse and its connection to the String Theory.<br><br>So I recommend everyone watching this video understand that so-called &quot;Big Freeze/Chill theory&quot; is just another theory. It&#39;s not like it is more developed or has more proofs than other theories, because all theories confirm or disconfirm their ideas each time. So be rational and believe what you think is right about it for YOU.<br><br>For me, the combination of this and the Big Bounce theory is the most intimidating, because everything is in infinite cicle that will never end, and, more of that, there are infinite versions of it in parallel universes.",0,[]
"By far the greatest thing I&#39;ve seen this week, or will see",0,[]
"There are scales in our universe that are so immense, it&#39;s understandable if we can barely grasp them. There&#39;s so much yet to learn. It&#39;s hard for us to comprehend dynamic chaotic systems. Especially vast systems. What if those immense scales, we don&#39;t yet fully grasp how things fully work? Like density, mass, Electromagnetism, static charges, fluid dynamics, temperature, pressure, radiation, velocity, etc. *I think there is a lot left to learn on these VAST scales throughout our cosmos? I hope we continuously try to improve our understanding of the cosmos over time because it would be foolish to think we fully understand these things. Especially when talking about scales of galactic filaments, multiple galaxies interacting, and many more cosmic bodies &amp; structures. We are getting better &amp; better but some things are just so vast it&#39;s understandable we don&#39;t yet fully grasp them yet. I&#39;m curious to see where things go as we advance our ability to study these things. <br><br>We can&#39;t have physics without those people who are great philosophers. Thought experiments will always be a useful tool. One thought experiment i like to ponder about is what we can learn from the science of the behavior of bubbles? I like to ponder about the structure and properties of the fabric of our own universe. Maybe with every black hole a bubble in the overall universe is created? Thus creating a structure of unique stability and instability bubbles throughout the overall universe...? (Just a hypothetical concept that&#39;s fun to ponder about) In the past people talked about space as an ether. Maybe bubble science theory could end up being a new way to theorize about space and the universe as a whole..? On all sorts of different levels.. because I&#39;m sure bubble science plays roles in all sorts of different levels of our universe. From the very small to the very large.. We even see that our own sun has a bubble around it, that is just a single bubble created by our sun&#39;s cosmic rays and its interaction with the surrounding cosmic neighborhood creates a boundary layer. That in itself seems to imply this is a common aspect of the nature of our universe, and we are just now starting to learn more about it, and measure it, visualize it, theorize about it... It&#39;s at least fascinating to me.. There are really interesting videos on the different aspects of science behind bubbles. It just fuels my curiosity about how things work. Nature is fascinating and it&#39;s really fun to ponder about the ways our natural world behaves.",0,[]

If death rate takes over, then they will stop.",1,[]

"Wouldn&#39;t all the black dwarfs eventually be pulled to one another as they increase in density? So at the end of time there would be a group or collection of dwarfs, possibly fusing into a larger mass like when black holes consume another one. And this final massive dwarf eventually collapses &amp; Supernovas,  resulting in a new Big Bang",0,[]
"So what I&#39;m hearing is that unlike the world, the universe won&#39;t end with a whimper, but a bang?",0,[]
Mandelbrot&#39;s cusp,0,[]
Why the mechanism behind black dwarfs&#39; collapse avoidance (the electron plasma resistance) doesn&#39;t prevent the collapse of all other star types?,0,[]
So.... Goes out with a bang? :),0,[]
What&#39;s supposed to happen to the light at the end?,0,[]
I hope i’ll just die and see reincarnate in the next universe as an option,0,[]
I actually wanted to know if black dwarfs exploded then won’t elements be mixed back into the universe and new stars be formed?,0,[]
"Okay so we knew the first thing to ever happen, now we know the last. We just gotta figure out the rest &#39;till then.",0,[]

"There&#39;s something strangely relieving about the existence of Black Dwarves to me.<br><br>The universe will eventually go out and die due to entropy... but it refuses to burn out until the very, very, very end. And when it does go, it&#39;ll give off one last beautiful boom, just for old times sake.",0,[]
"What about the fate of the fabric of spacetime ? What are the steps at the end ? Also, would the black dwarf be ripped of by the expansion of the universe at some point ?",0,[]
"Would that truly be the end though? Surely if a black dwarf went supernova, the remnants of that would also become a black hole and you would then be waiting for those black holes to decay via Hawking radiation once again? Then that would truly be the &quot;end&quot;...",0,[]
I just wonder if the explosion might actually set off the next big bang that then turns the other way black dwarves into the dark matter of the new universe.,0,[]
Now I wanna know what will happen when the sun dies. Do you have a video on that Kursgesagt??,0,[]
So we’re all going to ignore the fact that the thumb nail looks like a butt hole. Ok ,0,[]
"This video reminded me of the ending of Outer Wilds. Now I&#39;m kinda curious if Kurzgesagt knows of that game and if they would ever do a video on it, heh.",0,[]
How arrogant are humans that we think we know exactly how the universe will end? A reminder that science is always improving and self-correcting. We may yet discover something in the next hundreds to millions of years that will disprove this video.,0,[]
you can take any excerpt from this video and itd literally be a poem.,0,[]

Unless you randomly woke up one day a few months back and in a quantum-tunnelled instant that you&#39;ve gone from worrying about getting older to realising you <i>are</i> old and there&#39;s no way back that is.

Idk why we assume that the expansion of the universe will keep accelerating.

So why would such a creator now leave a universe then empty and purposeless with no life to just start a cyclical process?

"There should be a notation for the video that this fate of the universe is based on what will happen if protons do not decay. It is hypothesized that protons may be unstable with a half-life of ~10^36 years. If this turns out to be true then black dwarfs will decay long before black holes. The last interesting thing that happens in the scenario is the evaporation of black holes. After that, the universe will just be made of extremely diffuse dark matter, photons, neutrons, electrons, and positrons. Essentially nothing happens from here except the the occasional matter-antimatter annihilation. This universe has an age the is infinitesimally small when compared to the age of a universe in which protons do not decay.",0,[]

"I am stupid but I was thinking that maybe, at the end of time, black dwarves would be the only thing with gravity, which, if they are moving, would probably attract other black dwarves.

"Wait a sec so at the end of time.  The last thing to ever happen is possible multiple supernovas as ancient corpses of dead stars lights up the sky creating supernovas as bright as galaxies.   Which means that they will spill out material the essence of creation.    So that means in the end trillions upon trillions, upon trillions of dead corpses of stars across the verse will shine once more and release elements probably simple ones before.    It would be unimaginably long but after they all blink then die out it means that a last gift of the former universe is gas clouds or similar that will end up drifting among each other in the void.   <br><br>So in the end.   we get the words that starts the beginning.  <br><br>&quot;Let there be light&quot;.",0,[]

I would guess that if this is what will happen then that last thing will trigger additional things and we have a new big bang. Gravity will always attract even the smallest particles together.

"While it&#39;s an interesting story and theory, it seems to have a couple holes. First, the death of a black hole is purely theoretical, and it&#39;s based on Hawkings theory that black holes can slowly radiate energy.

How does any other form of energy &quot;slowly radiate&quot; from something that even energy moving at the fastest speed can&#39;t escape? <br><br>Second, there&#39;s that pesky conservation of matter law. While the idea that &quot;matter cannot be created nor destroyed&quot; is widely misconstrued, the &#39;destruction&#39; or &#39;creation&#39; of matter is simple a change in state between matter and energy. So what&#39;s happening with all the energy in this scenario? <br><br>But since this is all going to happen long after the Earth is dead and gone, and thanks to the fact that we will never be able to observe what&#39;s really happening in a black hole, all we can do are toss theories back and forth.

"I&#39;m not a QFT expert, but I do have a degree in Physics, and I&#39;m pretty sure that Quantum Tunnelling and Nuclear Fusion are not the same thing... Quantum tunneling has to do with an electron&#39;s probability field overlapping with a potential. Since an electron&#39;s position cannot be finitely determined, it always has a small chance to exist on the other side of a potential. Kind of like Schrodinger&#39;s Cat being both dead and alive, the electron is on both sides of the potential at the same time until the probability field collapses into one out come. But electrons have nothing to do with nuclei combining into a new element. Essentially Nucleus = Nuclear physics, Electrons = Chemistry. <br><br>Edit: also the &quot;absurd amount of time&quot; needed for these nuclei to fuse may be irrelevant if protons or electrons decay over a given amount of time.

"There is a major flaw in this video. It is impossible to destroy mater. It might change but it is eternal. Everything that is here now always was and will be. You can change it into something else, but you can&#39;t &quot;obliterate&quot; it. The last thing in the universe will never happen. Even if all the energy went away like this video suggested, the universe would just collapse on itself that would in itself create energy and the mass of all that material coming to create more energy. That would cause a big bang, which is how many scientists believe is how our current universe was created, but that is just one of many theories because no one was there or will be there. We are all just theorizing based on our current reference point. It is like when people used to think the earth thought the earth was the center of the galaxy, but now we know any point is the &quot;center&quot; when there is no boundary.

"It never ceases to amaze me how much presumption there is in science. It&#39;s simply preposterous for current scientists to think they can state these conjectures as if they&#39;re fact. It&#39;s ludicrous enough that they think they can state that there was a beginning to the universe, even more so that they think they know when and how that happened, and even more so still that they think they know it will end, and when and how. The reason they do it is that science is currently structured to encourage them - principally the Nobel Prize, which is done by CONSENSUS, which is anti-science and has given rise to such travesties as the climate scam. It&#39;s time to abolish the Nobel Prize, which was invented in the first place to assuage the guilt of the inventor of dynamite, the killer of millions in WW1. This video is pure conjecture passed off as fact. We need to save science by removing the motive for dishonest and absurd claims.",0,"['They don’t say this like they know this. Ask any scientists and mathematicians who partook in all the studies that got us what we did today, they’ll say they don’t know (some might say they do, but you might wanna check their ego). Seriously, no one claims they know all, and most likely they don’t do it for the reward of the Nobel prize, but just out of curiosity. But the thing is, this is way more accurate than whatever religion can teach you. This is done with observations of our very own universe paired with what we know of it, and then seeing what it leads to, it’s not just complete guesses, unlike religion which even claim they know it (I think, though prove me wrong on their ego in that place)']"

But quantum mechanics suggests that given enough time (long enough to make the time frames mentioned here seem like less than an eyeblink by comparison), through quantum tunneling, random things will happen even in a configuration that seemingly should be forever inactive. In fact, there&#39;s a line of thought that our Big Bang (and future ones) come about in exactly this way--there&#39;s a vanishingly small chance (so small that it&#39;s almost indistinguishable from zero, but crucially is not zero) that all the &quot;stuff&quot; will spontaneously go from that maximum entropy state (everything uniformly spread out in which events happening shouldn&#39;t be possible) to a near-zero entropy state, which is what the state that led to the Big Bang and cosmic inflation was.",7,[]

"I probably have heard this and forgot the explanation, but since I do not remember today...here is something that confuses me. For Stars not massive enough to become a Neutron Star.<br>1st Normal Star...I feel dumb. &#39;Normal Star&#39; does not become a Dwarf Star;-(<br>Ah shucks! In theory a Red Dwarf NEVER is a &#39;normal star like the Sun&#39; IE any star with too little mass to be in the average or big leagues of stars...is a Dwarf Star as long as it has enough mass for some fusion inside it.<br>2nd Red Dwarf...Does Have Fusion, but the rate is slow.<br>3rd White Dwarf...no more Fusion, or very little. Cools Off for Trillions of years before Black Dwarf Stage.<br>So a White Surface is a higher Surface Temperature than a Red Surface.<br>What confuses me (but I think I just remembered the explanation, I will end with that I guess since I do not want to delete this) What confused me is ah; Red Dwarf and White Dwarf both have &quot;Dwarf&quot; in the name...so in my own mind I was thinking a Red Dwarf is the same size as a White Dwarf...which does not make sense if the White Dwarf has a higher Surface temperature.<br>Okay so I think the explanation I forgot, and just partially remembered; a Red Dwarf is smaller than when it was  a mainstream or average star, BUT a Red Dwarf is still much much larger than it will be when it becomes a White Dwarf. You can blow up a common balloon, then put it into the freezer; it becomes smaller because lower temperature is less volume for gases. When a Red Dwarf stops or say reduces Fusion by 99% it has less energy to remain at that diameter...so it will shrink from lack of Fusion Energy. Then as a White Dwarf it becomes HOTTER, but not from Fusion...from Degeneracy Pressure or the Atoms Resisting Compression = the new source of heat that takes so long to dissipate. Trillions of years to cool down is hard to think of as a real amount of time, but that is what Astronomers say...<br>I could still have errors, but I hope my rambling and even my better understanding of this distinction between the two types of Dwarf Stars...helps a few people get the differences better. Me attempting to explain my confusion...helped me reduce my own confusion, so that is cool.",0,"['Okay I was definitely wrong about something else.<br>My mental definition of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; was &quot;ALL Red Dwarfs that are X years old, would be the same because they are all called Red Dwarfs&quot; That was my mental definition or my assumption; assumptions you do notice you can consider the merits of...but assumptions you do not even notice ARE assumptions, you cannot consider the merits of because you see them as Truth and thus not something worth questioning. <br>So anyway that assumption was totally wrong;-(<br>A Red Dwarf with enough mass to have Fusion, but not enough mass to ever fuse Heavy Elements and become a Red Giant...is very very different than for example our Sun that is supposed to become a much more massive Red Dwarf after it&#39;s Red Giant Phase ends.

"Kurzgesagt is just so fun to watch. As an astrophysicist studying black holes, the way such easy to understand scientific communication is carried out through good research, animations with stories and characters, and with the help of the community, your channel has consistently inspired me to better myself with communicating science and its core philosophies (with the child-like wonder intact). I&#39;ve been here since day 1 and I&#39;d like to appreciate Steve Taylor - the signature voice and vibe of this channel! Although I always see comments on the team&#39;s work which is in itself commendable, let&#39;s not forget the world in which Steve sends us through his voice with each remarkable video.

Then from there, there are several lecture series on youtube for tensor calculus and differential geometry!

First a black holes gravity would cause spegghetification because of gravitational waves, but what if because of time dialation the particles can go no further than the event horizon, and instead create a plank shell of matter. this plank shell houses a sort of vacuum of dark energy and as the shell grows as more matter falls in and adds to the shell, the dark energy grows. Hawking radiation forms near the event horizon, negative mass particles fall in and create small gaps that last only fractions of a second, but are drawn out by time dilatation, adding non gravity effected dark energy to the universe? Just a thought i had, probably crazy and un-scientific. Wanted to run it past someone in the community.', 'I just listen and disagree because scripture gets better looking women than science']"

"@kurzgesagt Great Video!<br>But I want to correct somethings and ask some questions:<br>1. This video makes 3 important assumptions: proton decay does not happen, but Hawking raditions does happen and the universe expands forever.<br>This is ok, but I think it would be worth mentioning somewhere in the video.<br>2. Wouldn&#39;t neutron stars survive even longer under these assumptions? Maybe even forever? (Since no nuclear fusion can happen inside the, except maybe in a thin outer layer)<br>3. white/black dwarfs falling into a super massive black hole would likely just fall into the black hole without getting ripped apart.<br>4. By then black holes will have no accretion disk any more. I know this is just done for the animation; Showing complete darknes just makes no sence for a video. I just want to point that out.<br>5. Absolute zero is -273.15 °C not -268°C. (I don&#39;t know where this number comes from)<br>6. White darfws explode in type 1a supernova because when the electrons can no longer support the star against the pressure of gravity the nulcei are pressed together and fuse. White darfs are made mostly of C12 and O16 nuclei, when fused into havier nuclei like  Ne20, Mg24, Si28 or Ni56 release massive amounts of energy. However a black darf should be mostly made of Fe56, from the fusion of ligther nulcei into and then the decay of Ni56 into Co56 into Fe56. Since Fe56 cannot fuse into any other nuclei and release enery the black dwarf should just collapse into a neutron star, because no (significant) amount of energy would be released by nuclear fusion.<br>7. There are more assumptions made: We don&#39;t know and likely will never know if nuclei can fuse at any tempeture, as out calculations suggest, because observing it may be impossible. We just don&#39;t know or just can&#39;t understand what &quot;FOREVER&quot; even means. Some theories suggest that anything can randomly happen given insane amouts of time...",0,[]
You are making a lot of assumptions that are going to be proven wrong. What I see happening is that the vacuum of space will always create phenomena happening so the cosmos will never ever be silent and static. There will be times of gazillions of years maybe when nothing happens I will give you that but overall everything will restart and repeat over and over again. Even universes.,1,"['I agree. Perhaps this is the big bang itself. Science has not advanced enough to know 100% what happened in the past nor what will happen in the future to 100%. Perhaps that is where reality converges and we reach the top of the loop. Unable to look past because......we&#39;ve already been there in a way. Could also explain Deja Vu and if our &quot;Consciounce&quot; has already lived a thousand lives on Earth, or on a different planet, or planets in different galaxies that number in the trillions if not more.

Then Gravity split off as the universe expanded. Then electromagnetism split off, and atomic nuclei could form. Then electrons started matching up with those nuclei. Then the weak nuclear force split off. Then finally stars could start to form.

Such massive WDs are rather rare, most WDs have masses around 0.6 Msun, as you say.   Only WDs at the upper end of this mass range might have enough non-iron material when they collapse and ignite to have a thermonuclear explosion with no remnant - although the detailed circumstances required may not be quite clear as due to gravitational settling all the heavy material may be in the core of the WD  - otherwise the WDs would just collapse to a neutron star and make an electron capture supernova.",0,[]

If nothing exists, there will be nothing. But something exists. I don’t care about the state of that something. At this point it exists. Earth exists. Humanity is exists. Universe exists. And this confuses me so much. What if universe did not exist? Would there be our scientific explanation? Would there be anything? Between what comes before the origin of our Universe and the end of our universe is pretty much explained. But why? And how? This question boggles my mind every single day. I look at the stars and observe their beauty and how far they are from us. And then I observe a brick. A simple brick in a masonry house.  And the sheer complexity of it all baffles me. A singularity which resulted in us being here now. And then the realisation that matter exists… but what if nothing existed?

"No, the universe today is mainly experiencing pain and suffering throughout the billions of galaxies in it, because primitive biospheres full of wildlife animals subjected to the gruesome, relentless, ruthless Darwinian species selection mechanisms causes astronomical extents of harm. The universe objectively should better have never existed, because it is mainly producing suffering, and this is a scientifically solidly supported conclusion.<br><br>&quot;Wild animal suffering is the suffering experienced by nonhuman animals living outside of direct human control, due to harms such as disease, injury, parasitism, starvation and malnutrition, dehydration, weather conditions, natural disasters, and killings by other animals,[1][2] as well as psychological stress.[3] Some estimates indicate that these individual animals make up the vast majority of animals in existence.[4] An extensive amount of natural suffering has been described as an unavoidable consequence of Darwinian evolution[5] and the pervasiveness of reproductive strategies which favor producing large numbers of offspring, with a low amount of parental care and of which only a small number survive to adulthood, the rest dying in painful ways, has led some to argue that suffering dominates happiness in nature.[1][6][7] &quot;<br><br>Other than this, I have proof that the vast majority of astronomical observations indicate that the dark (relativistic neutrino) energy phenomenon is fueled by the dark matter that stars radiate in the form of hot neutrinos, which will eventually run out, and that therefore a big crunch will happen in the future, upon which a hyper-massive black hole will form, which may then explode due to post-iron super-nuclear fusion to lead into another cycle, though since the whole process should be dampened further and further between each cycle due to energy loss to photons and relativistic neutrinos radiating outwards into empty space, this process eventually should find its end in a small enough hyper-massive black hole state that is incapable of such post-iron super-nuclear fusion.",1,[]

Time is relative. Considering in this scenario universal expansion has been happening for an absurd amount of time each of these events will be so far from eachother in spacetime that they will essentially be their own universes - so there is no difference between 1 and many of these events as they will all be completely isolated completely unable to interact with any of the other objects within &quot;the universe&quot;', 'and its not even one final moment because there are tons of white dwarfs. like a series of fireworks at the end of the universe.', '@Cewla I always find it interesting that the end-state of entropy is perfect order.', '@fallenstar17 it just.. freezes. the energy is spread so far apart, and entropy wins. matter breaks down as the overwhelming pressure of entropy kills every last remaining THING. nothing happens, at the greatest scale.', '\u200b\u200b@D00mnoodleIt will drift away if it&#39;s far enough away from other gravitationap objects like other black dwarves or stray gases still floating about.

Basically, you only need a grain of sand&#39;s worth of mass in an area the size of earth to stop the expansion. But space is big and dark energy expands space which creates more space, so an area of the universe without much matter will expand quickly and accellerate since new space created means more dark energy, like in between galaxy groups, but areas with lots of matter don&#39;t expand, like solar systems or in this case the black dwarf/black dwarves orbiting.

"My own theory.   Space-time is a material that is mostly only defined by its size and envelope, that within  it, we know all the rules of physics as we know them.   This spacetime is gravitationally attractive, but since its everywhere and has almost no mass individually, the resulting attraction is generally zero, though it is a big enemy of changing inertia.   When it is pulled into a gravity well however things change.   as it passes over and through various energy forms, including us, it creates quantum foam.  But in the meantime, it is annihilated into heat at the center of gravity wells, and is created by photons interacting with more spacetime to create redshift which allows a cycle exchange of energy to occur.   (Redshift also happens  but cutting your actual distances to nearly half in some situations really changes quite a few calculations, on local Solar scales this is like extra um&#39;s if its noticed at all, however it becomes annoyingly painful to ignore at the parsec level tho.)  Once all the light in the Universe has been used up however, things change very quickly and as the space-time is used up by various black holes and black dwarfs, and once not being replaced, the distances between these objects becomes very short very quickly (millions of years).   orbital mechanics go out the window and many of these collide head on instead of the normal dance of inward spinning, however when enough of these occur, a tipping point falls and the largest black holes no longer have an outer pressure to keep them stable, as they had sucked up the last of the space time, and with this disruption of gravity, they explode.",0,[]

"When these black dwarves go supernova, do they not return most of their iron back to the cosmos?

Would this new mind numbingly long life cycle continue forever?<br><br>What of the gas giants which remain? Presumably they also cold-fusion into iron, but they&#39;re too small to collapse into a supernova; regular electromagnetic forces hold it up just like the earth.

That said, Si28 is one of the more common outcomes of the de-excitation, and hence of the initial direct O16+O16 reaction.

"So, I have a weird theory <br><br>So a light cone is the shape of spacetime if the big bang produced more then one light cone just made up of different matter like anti matter ect and if those universes were like our sooner or later the light cone stops expanding it could theoretically be shrunk basically into an infinitely small point because with out any entropy time technically doesn&#39;t exists. So what if the infinitely small point was the state before the big bang. Now you say how can it expand again like the beginning of the universe that&#39;s the interesting part. What if the black wholes aren&#39;t just consuming material into an infinitely small point what if the black whole also pushes information out into another universes because technically at the bottom of the black whole is the end of time because of the density. So it basically leaks hawkin radiation but also leaks out information into the infinitely small point to be connected to the end of the light cone. Maybe that&#39;s why the big band happened. It also could be the reason quatum mechanically we and all thing do what we do, because before the time space there was only tons of information that could be only reproduced in a broken way almost like having a video game that is old and glitch then you buy the remake it seems the same just a little different. That&#39;s also kinda shows the idea of multi universes, but here the thing is that with enough time, everything you can think of probably happened. <br><br>Everything is two points beginning and end and there&#39;s a sting connecting the two no matter how much moving you can&#39;t avoid the beginning or the end but you can influence the sting to look different each time that&#39;s our universe.",0,[]

"It said that the last black drwarf explodes into a supernova ans then the universe is truly dead. But when a supernova explodes  the outer layers of the star are propelled into space by the expanding shock wave creating a supernova remnant, a type of nebula. Sometimes the exploded star will partially collapse into a black hole or a neutron star, and the rest of the mass will get converted into energy or will be blown away from the force of the explosion. The shockwave and the gas it carries can compress other gas clouds in space enough to trigger star formation. Doesn&#39;t this mean that the universe just start all over?",0,[]

"We call it things like dead boring universe, and the &quot;last thing to happen&quot;&quot; but I feel like it is more like the universe getting more and more alien to our human perception. After all, we define the words dead and boring. Who says a black dwarf is less interesting and eventful than an active star? It feels arbitrary. Compared to the first instances of the universe, things are unfathomably slow and eventless  in comparasion right now. So it&#39;s all a matter of perspective really. This describes the last thing that is meaningful to us, as humans. But the void of quantum foam that comes after is just equally the universe and equally universes like the universe universes now. Of course, that doesn&#39;t make for as good of a story to make a youtube video about, but hey.",0,[]

"kurzgesagt I love you but you must stop spreading lies. <br><br>This theory is just that, a theory. and dont give me the &quot;its a scientific theory&quot; they have not observed anything close to this happening its all purely a guess and I encourage you all to look it up yourself.<br><br>This is science fiction, not reality. <br><br>I mean this whole premise assumes the universe was created from nothing. Nothing just randomly became something. Then it wasn&#39;t nothing to begin with. <br><br>I didnt realize this when I was an athiest but Jesus is the way the truth and the life, the uncaused cause. this is why in quantum physics theres a &quot;god particle&quot; this is why your body has a &quot;cross cell&quot; that holds you together. This is why you are made from the same elements as dirt because mad was created from dirt.<br><br>Jesus was a real person who did real miracles and really died on the cross 2023 years ago, this has been historically documented the same as Julius Caesar doing all the things he did. So if you believe in Julius Caesar you must believe in Jesus for the same metrics. Wether you want to live with him for eternity is different but you cant deny he is The Son of God.",0,[]

While this is called the heat death of the universe.  There is something worth mentioning.  This is all bassed on our current understanding of the universe.  <br><br>But could there be more to it?  The problem is we don&#39;t even know where the matter in the universe came from.  Or what it was like prior to matter being introduced.  So what they are describing in this could be the universe going back to a state prior to matter.  But we also know that you cannot truely destroy anything.  You can change it.  But turning something to nothing.  Just not really possiable.  At least to what we understand.  <br><br>So it is also possiable that after everything ends.  It may start up again.  The cycle of death and rebirth.  Something rather common in our universe.<br><br>So after everything is gone and spead out as tin as possiable adoms will start to attract to each other and clumping together due to their gravity.  And over a time frame even more un imagionable.  Everything will just start to slowly form again in the dark.  Matter starts to gather again.  Gas nevulas form in the darkness.  Til the first star forms once again.  <br><br>For all we know this has happened countless times before.  This could be the 10th to the trillionth times this has happened.  We wouldn&#39;t have a clue.  And may never be able to figure that out.<br><br>Reason I point thisnout is.  For as smart as we tend to think we are.  In the face of the mysteries of the galaxy we really don&#39;t know shit.

Momentarily broken from a mental void, his eyes flickered and sight broadened to the same outside his window: a shimmering, expansive glow. At the near end of all things, he fell witness, transfixed, to a distant flash, signaling the demise of the last light -- leaving only an endless, tenebrous veil. Understanding hit him as his head softly plummeted back into position; as much, his eyes dimmed, quenching the feigned light above him.

"To me, the part of matter and anti-matter disappearing completely kinda bother me. Like how something can disappear completely from the universe? Maybe it is something too small and impossible to see or to measure and we consider to just disappear?",0,"['@JaJe No, sadly not. The issue is that there is a difference between &quot;Energy&quot; and &quot;usable energy&quot;. In order to actually make use of energy there has to be low entropy in the system. Like, if you have a room with cold air at the top, and hot air at the bottom, you can stick a turbine in the middle, the hot air rises, and moves the turbine, giving usable energy. But once the air has mixed it&#39;s all the same luke-warm temperature. The total energy of the air hasn&#39;t changed, but there&#39;s now maximum entropy, everything&#39;s fully mixed together, and so nothing can happen in that room any more. It&#39;s reached it&#39;s stable state.<br><br>I&#39;m probably not doing a great job of explaining, so I&#39;d encourage you to look into the idea of the &quot;heat death of the universe&quot;.', '@MyLittleDashie 7 Thanks for explanation, but if the matter transforms into energy, then the universe will not end even that as the same energy can be reconverted back to matter and the universe will exists forever?', 'Matter is fundamentally the same thing as energy.

"Im just confused on where all the matter goes. <br><br>I don’t believe in any ideas of the universe being capable of “dying”, but I do believe in it remaining dormant. <br><br>I believe the big bang has always been a coalesced mix of mass gathering at the center. But what does all the matter turn into? <br><br>Like… when a black dwarf explodes. Is it just nothing? It cant be right? Its all still there; just floating in space. Wouldn’t it mean overtime that, one giant ball of dead matter thats been spent be capable of fusing together with quantum fusion and theoretically make another big bang of sorts? <br><br>I personally think the “Big Bang” is a cycle of quantum physics. When enough things die out, theres bound to be a gravitational force somewhere that begins to exponentially expand overtime that turns into another big bang. I think right now, somewhere far deep into the expanses of space, the dark matter? <br><br>Dark matter isn’t whats expanding. Its whats already there in space. The big bang is expanding; but not space and time itself. Space is always a perpetual void of intangible liquid and dark matter is what dead space is. <br><br>That dead space is there from many previous big bangs. We don’t know if we are the first, or last big bang, but we do know that we are on SOME sort of bang. <br><br>Its all interesting to think about and theorize of what space is. I see a lot of people thinking its expanding. Who’s to say that; we aren’t just some pocket of our own? <br><br>Space is practically infinite! If we jump through that dark matter on the edges of our observable universe and travel through it; like its some sort of fog, we may pop out on the other side in another universe entirely! Completely random and bizarre just like the last with all of its beautiful nature of technology, life, and possible people like us. <br><br>I dont think there is such things as multiple timelines or alternate universes and that sort of thing; but I do believe in the idea of the big bang being something that didn’t just kickstart the beginning of everything, because the beginning of everything was always present. There’s nothing else to confuse about it. It simply has always been present and theres no possible answer because of it. <br><br>Could ramble on and on about stupid ideas in space.

I have an advanced physics question now: we know that the rate at which the universe is expanding is slowly increasing with time, and the events described in this video happen in cosmological times, so doesn&#39;t this come into play? Will the brown dwarves die out before the electrons are stripped away from one another because of the expansion of the universe?",0,"['@Hermann Barbato again we can measure the flatness of the universe and that will tell us which model to use. Right now we are basically measuring a flat universe in our most accurate measurements of this which means it will NOT be a big rip. They take this measurement by looking at fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background but im not sure myself exactly the science behind that measurement. What your looking for is measuring the curvature of the universe k constant in the Friedman equation. Searching that should lead you to more info', 'Thank you, yes, this is what I was talking about. On the other hand, I was reading on Wikipedia we still are not sure about which model prevails. If the Big Rip was to be true, it could happen as soon as 1.5*10^11 years from now, making most of this video useless. Why do you say that the Big chill is the most probable?', 'What you are talking about is something akin to a &quot;Big Rip Model&quot;. This requires a negatively curved spacetime aka a k factor less than 1. In that case indeed the accelerating expansion of space due to &quot;dark energy&quot; or the cosmological constant will cause ripping apart of particles even on the subatomic levels. However this fate is not the predicted fate of our universe. We&#39;ve measured and from what we can tell the universe is essentially &quot;flat&quot; in a 4d sense with a k factor of 1. This means that although the acceleration of the expansion of the universe will occur, it will only be seen at the intergalactic scale of distances. This model is called &quot;the big chill&quot; where everything ends in heat death, and ends up as homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scales. You can look this up yourself by looking at the friedmann equation when solved for the expansion factor of the universe. Hopefully my explanation helped but if not i gave you a lot of the keywords you can use to look more detail into this. Cosmology is a fascinating subject.', 'No, by the time that happens, electrons will be able to identify as something else without consequence']"

"Connection terminated. I&#39;m sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve been misinformed. You&#39;re not here to recieve a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labirynth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don&#39;t even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach. But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.<br><br>And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that&#39;s not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away, as the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still, and give up your spirits. They don&#39;t belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although for one of you, the darkest pit of hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don&#39;t keep the devil waiting old friend.<br><br>My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It&#39;s in your nature to protect the innocent. I&#39;m sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms, the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you? I should have known you wouldn&#39;t be contempt to just disappear, not my daughter. I couldn&#39;t save you then, so let me save you now.<br><br>It&#39;s time to rest.
