After getting the 1 out of 1 000 000 trophy...I felt it. The satisfaction. The reward. The gratify... It felt good. It was the best. I will never forget this moment.,66,0
All this effort for rock paper scissors I love it,2,0
I lost in the fourth round. And I kept watching. While I was no longer playing  it was fun to watch the odds and their comparisons grow to greater and higher heights.,12,0
As a Bonnie Bee I can this video alone is worth 100% of a 1-month ($5 USD) or even really 3 months for those who are honest. &lt;3,5,0
This video was great!,0,0
You made me laugh out loud at the sheer scale of this while playing. Your videos are always awesome!,11,0
Back in the dark ages  when the earth was still cooling and I was working on my Master&#39;s degree  one of the assignments was to come up with an idea for a web site. Our group&#39;s idea was to do a choose your own adventure kind of book. We had to make a demo of the site  and that was hard work for 4 of us with no HTML experience. (Yes  back then you actually had to code your own HTML. Oh  the horrors!!) I can&#39;t imagine how much harder this was to accomplish than our puny little demo site with only a handful of pages. <br><br>Thank you for doing this. It was a lot of fun to try a couple of times honestly  then cheat my way through multiple paths to the end.,42,0
Managed to get better than 1700 in the whole billions. So not too shabby.  This was so old school awesome - I appreciate the hard work!!,15,0
Can I get permission to cheat now? Please? Just to quench my curiosity?,6,0
I gladly ended at the bliss of ending at 1 in a million<br><br>I truly hated Grey pointing out the unlikeliness of everything,0,0
so fun :),1,0
well I missed most of those hundred videos,0,0
That was really great! Great game and message!,2,0
My adblocker automatically blocks ad cards and I had no clue what on earth was going on in that video,5,0
The worst part about all of this is that  assuming we&#39;re honest players who ended the game when we lost and totally didn&#39;t go back and change our answers so we&#39;d win  this means that there are so many videos Grey put up that won&#39;t be viewed by a large number of the contestants. So much effort  so little &quot;profit&quot; so to speak.,1299,2
Is it cheating that I want to know what happens if you get all the way through?,5,0

Just wanted to say  your RPS game was much appreciated. Thank you for the experience. It was only a few minutes for me  but the hours and weeks and months you put into this will not go unappreciated. Thank you again for your time investment. Here to you  Grey! ,152,0

Proud Anti-luck here!,2,0
I spent a good 2 hours watching ALL of the videos  I&#39;m pretty sure. My computer science graph traversing algorithms knowledge was finally useful for something!,96,0
All I could think about while running through the videos was how enormous the work must have been to create it. It was really cool though seeing it.,27,0
had no idea you posted a game,0,0
I played it yesterday and lost immediately  then explored some of the paths and mused  &quot;This is the craziest abuse of YouTube I have ever seen. It must have taken him ages to do this. Respect.&quot;,566,1
Can I cheat now to get all the endings,156,0
What a rush… still got a buzz from thinking about it 27odd chances in a row,18,0
Hello  Grey! I really love your videos. This project has been the best bit of content you&#39;ve every made. In the next video  can you dive deeper on these statistics and find the chances of the trails we took? I know this is something you said you&#39;d only put in ur patreon page  but I think we all want to dive in to find just how lucky or unlucky we are.,13,0
You really done did a game design on that one. Congrats!,6,0
This was amazingly fun and I can’t believe how much effort went into making it you’re amazing!,3,0
