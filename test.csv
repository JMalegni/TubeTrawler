"Serious question: in this day and age of very powerful over-the-horizon radars and increasingly inexpensive and reliable access to space and on-orbit early warning systems, why build/maintain/emphasise a counterforce strategy and the more expensive weapons that strategy entails?

Apart from the retreat from Afghanistan it was percieved superior western culture with everything from Hollywood films and even Levi jeans vs long breadlines in Moscow.

This is old news and irrelevant to today&#39;s nuclear weapons. The  Newton nuclear weapons were first developed years ago. They can be produced in any magnitude from one that can take out a whole country or a rifle gernaders the time to wait is less than a hour and no radiation. 1 destroy nothing but mammals and leaves no everything else untouched a new tank is not harmed but the soldiers are dead. If the world&#39;s leaders would trade in the old thermal nuclear weapons and use Newton in stead then no harm to the environment. The contrys involved would just have fewer people cow&#39;s and pigs. I don&#39;t know if they would be safe to eat . 2 Newton 2 is just like a thermal nuclear bomb except the radiation goes away in a hour . <br>     We could kill each other and not harm the environment of the earth.,0,[]

"@PerunAU talks nonsense about tritium. Using stored tritium for atomic weapons is unlikely to work because it is radioactive enough that just the heat would cause problem.

"I think that even if we assume 80% of Russia&#39;s arsenal is nonfunctional due to corruption, maintenance, etc etc etc...20% is enough.",0,[]
"I once attended a presentation from the guy, who at the time, was in charge of the maintenance and reliability of our nuclear weapons. He described the difficulty of testing and maintenance under the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty roughly as follows. Imagine you are in charge of a vast collection of old classic cars and it’s your responsibility to make sure each and every one of them will actually start the first time you turn the key, but while you can test and repair or replace individual components such as the battery, fuel pump, starter motor etc., you can’t ever actually turn the key and start one. I found that quite thought provoking.",60,[]
Lots of good stuff in here.  But the reliability issue is huge.  Let&#39;&#39;s not forget that if a missile/warhead fails that could mean it blow up the launch area.

"Forgive me for not being able to remember a lot of specifics, but I remember watching a great video on YT earlier this year about how one of the Obama era weapon extension programs suffered a multi billion $ setback, not because of problems with the pit, or tritium, but because of a synthetic chemical in the trigger system (I think). The story was, this chemical was made for decades in one of those Oppenheimer era labs. The process had essentially become boutique, they had specs and notes, but the machines they did it on and the highly trained people that did it had individual knowledge that just didn&#39;t translate into the docs. The lab got spun down after the Cold War, and the people who did the job retired or passed away. Then when time came to try and make more of this chemical, the folks replicating the process came up with a much better refined result using modern equipment... which turned out not to work. It took them tens of millions in analysis to figure out why. Turns out the old school refinement process, while less efficient, ended up with some key electrochemical differences in the product because of complicated stuff like phase transitions and synthesis rates that was essentially unique to the way they were doing stuff in the old lab. So the scientists tried to go back to square one, but learned what I already mentioned about the old equipment and the notes and the former workers. There just wasn&#39;t enough pieces of that specialized knowledge left to replicate it the old way. So they had to spend even more tens of millions on a &#39;new&#39; &#39;old&#39; fabrication system, that got a product with the old properties but using current equipment.<br><br>Wish I could remember where/when I saw it because it was fascinating.",1,['Fogbank was the material.<br><br>Channel was half as intresting (most likely)']

In general, the idea was to use an airburst nuclear explosion miles above and miles away from a city to disrupt or destroy Russian bombers flying from over the North Pole.

"Another factor in the reliability of a nuclear deterrent is the degree of confidence in the users of these weapons to actually launch them when ordered to do so. They might be unwilling or unable to launch them at the time. This could be for a variety of reasons such as disruptions in communications, attacks on their platforms, lack of vigilance in readiness, or simple refusal. Both the Soviets and the USA took these factors into consideration when deciding how many nukes to have ready. This is further explanation why they had tens of thousands of warheads and numerous weapons for each target.",5,['This human factor however can be and is regularly tested - the operators usually don&#39;t know if they are just training or actually deleting the world. <br>It&#39;s more depending on if the president or whoever is in charge is willing to give the order']

If most of the Russian submarine fleet is in port it too is quite vulnerable, likely to be demolished in a first strike. If Russia also believes the US to have a secret arsenal of say 100 or 200 ABMs stockpiled somewhere, and they also assume that say half of their ICBM and SLBM fleet fails before they deploy their warheads, then they might think that there is a real risk of the US being able to do a first strike at some point within the next decade, if they continue to build up their ABMs and improving their first strike accuracy and speed.",0,[]

"I want to make a point here, mostly for those who think a &#39;failure&#39; of the Russian nuclear ordnance equals no blast. Equal no boom, equals safety. <br><br>Wrong. Very, very wrong. <br><br>The thing is if we&#39;re talking two stage fusion devices, a failed blast can still be a nuclear blast. Just a fission one instead. A device that could put out a 100kt, 150kt blast might still be a 10kt, 15kt. Even if it doesn&#39;t go nuclear, that&#39;s still a whole heap of highly radioactive ionising emitting material in the air scattered over a city. It&#39;s still dangerous. It&#39;s still in the thousands of casualties. <br><br>Even potentially possible, a more neutron heavy blast. It might not produce a mushroom cloud, but you wish it was because of the few square kilometres worth of instant cancer to death.  <br><br>Nuclear explosions are rather picky things. They have particular requirements and those requirements can be very easily upset. Don&#39;t get enough neutrons? It fails. See above on how it&#39;s still dangerous. Get that first stage implosion wrong? Well, still dangerous. Get too many neutrons sucked out of the reaction? You might have kicked the legs out from the reaction, but you have the same problem as the first. If too much of the material in the first stage implosion is too degraded, you don&#39;t get enough of the required neutrons for and to maintain the runaway chain reaction? Same problem as above. <br><br>If you know the word fizzle, that&#39;s part of what I&#39;m talking about. <br><br>Safe to say that nukes are scary, scary things. They&#39;re designed to go boom when someone pushes the button and are fairly well guaranteed to go boom. <br><br>Should you have some questions, yes. Should you have questions like &#39;what mode of failure are you suggesting?&#39; or &#39;are you talking about delivery of the bomb/warhead or the bomb/warhead itself?&#39; Perhaps most importantly, &#39;do you know nuclear physics enough to understand why a bomb or warhead might fail?&#39;<br><br>Notes; the examples given are just that, examples.

"This is exactly right. I hear all kinds of aggregated data points that show way higher housing starts but where i live very very few new housing starts are going on and like you said mostly its demo an old home and building a new one on the same land. This is why i have come to the conclusion that i need to buy land in NH and develop a few lots and build on one my self. I own a small excavation company so its dirt cheap for me to do that and I will go with modular or log cabin kit not custom stick build. I see no way tge market here will change. I do think we have enough land though, its just super illegal to build anything on it due to land use regulations and they are oy getting more restrictive. Like my sister lives in Carlisle and that town requires 4 acre min build to build single family. She has been 8 years trying to get a single family permitted on 12 acres, all the tree huggers team up all the residents that dont want neighbors to make it extremely hard to build. Carlisle has only 5000 people and it could support 10x that many people on the land but people dont want it to be bigger, and there are a bunch of towns just like it in metro areas. Eventually boomers will die off and inventory will increase but that will be in 15-20 years. I lived in the midwest for a few years and thought about it again but its too far away from my friends  and family in MA.

"Regarding the reliability of the R-36, I&#39;ll copy a comment I made elsewhere:<br><br>Some Russian nukes probably don&#39;t work. <br>I&#39;m sure that in the last year or so, we&#39;ve all heard people arguing the case that Russian nuclear weapons must be unreliable, for various reasons such as sanctions or the obviously poorly maintained conventional forces. For the most part, I&#39;ve dismissed this as baseless speculation. However, there is one system I am  reasonably assured to be at risk of suffering reliability problems; The R-36M2 Voidoda (SS-18 Satan II). This is due to the termination of the contract for R-36 maintenance by Ukraine in 2015 following the annexation of Crimea. The R-36 is the only Ukrainian designed, manufactured and maintained ICBM in the Russian arsenal. Early versions of the R-36 had a guaranteed storage life of 5 years, later extended to 7.5 years. I&#39;m not aware of any indication that this was further extended, or that Russia has developed the domestic capability to maintain them since 2015. The latter seems unlikely given the development of the RS-28, which had an originally planned in-service date of 2018, so it&#39;s reasonable to conclude all the 34 R-36s currently in service are beyond their guaranteed storage life, and thus are of questionable reliability. From what I&#39;ve been able to find, it hasn&#39;t flown since 2013. The R-36 is the centrepiece of the Russian counterforce capability, and the heaviest ICBM in the world. It represents approximately 7% of the total active Russian ballistic missile arsenal, up to 16% of the active strategic missile warhead count, and about 6% of the entire weapon arsenal. It began formal retirement in 2021, and was slated to begin to be replaced with the RS-28 last Autumn, though there have been significant delays, the precise cause of which isn&#39;t publicly known for sure, (though the delays in flight testing were reportedly due to issues with the missile &quot;command module&quot;). It&#39;s possible the second flight test in February this year was a failure. Russia claimed to have begun mass production of the RS-28 missile last Summer. The 302nd Missile Regiment has been disarmed of its 6 R-36 missiles, and its Uzhur missile field has been undergoing upgrades to accommodate the RS-28 since 2021, which was still ongoing as of March this year.",22,[]

You cannot do that, unless you put such mines at hundreds of miles from your shores.', 'Probably because the possibility of a nuclear mine laying out to drift off/get snatched by third parties/accidental detonation on wrong ship/finding the thing afterward does not appeal to those who could implement it. Nukes have always had a strong component of control/active accountability.', 'Pfft, sea mines. How about a delayed-action nuclear mine with a live chicken for detonator? That was legitimately considered, I kid you not. The antithesis of the Schrodinger&#39;s cat.', '@The Orion&#39;s arm That’s just how you would deploy a mine like that. Place it on the sea floor in an area where a fleet will pass or will be stationed and activate it when the fleet is in the area. No need for pinpoint accuracy. Several areas are perfectly suited for nuclear sea mines. Any straight or gulf, any continental shelf would be perfect.']"

"I&#39;ve never understood why people think World War III will:<br>a) involve dropping nuclear bombs on the enemy.<br>b) lead to the end of the world.<br>People thought the same about WWII and chemical weapons, but it didn&#39;t happen because everyone had them and knew the consequences.",3,"['Chemical weapons weren&#39;t particular effective against the enemy&#39;s military if the enemy was prepared for them. The Germans got some advantage in the first few months of their use in 1915. Afterwards, better gasmasks made them less useful. They killed maybe 1% of all the men killed (although did wreck the health of many more some of whom died prematurely after the way) There was no particular incentive to use them in the Second World War. The Italians used chemical weapons effectively in Abyssinia because their enemy didn&#39;t have good equipment to deal with the likes of mustard gas. Nuclear weapons are completely different. Imagine say NATO decided to enter the Ukraine war. Russia has the choice of either surrendering, trying to fight NATO or using a tactical nuclear weapon to warn NATO to back off. You can see the attraction of that last option.', 'NIce trolling attempt, I give you a 4/10, you could have scored higher but b) made me question your cognitive abilities in general. <br><br>And in the case you are genuine, dont be surprised when people dont share your rosy assessment of the situation even in the slightest, especially when they read the corresponding military doctrines of said nations and know what nuclear fallout and the darkening of the sky would mean for the world.', 'B) is still very plausible, although it depends on who presses first and who retaliates. There are also different types of nukes (Strategic/Tactical) as well as a way higher yield than when it was conceptualized. Plus given the current state of the world, one of these set offs could have some apocalyptic implications... Up to this point and time everyone knows it&#39;s a game you don&#39;t win. Although that doesn&#39;t stop the threats as well as another nation from developing their own (Iran). M.A.D. keeps all parties in the balance but once the card is pulled; there will be no deck.', 'It will, once conventional forces on any side have been defeated, the next bit will be tactical nuclear weapons, then strategic, no way around it sonny boy', 'Mostly because the common image of WW3 is based on the doomsday scenarios of the late Cold War where thousands or tens of thousands of warheads would be flying if the trigger got pulled. This meme was repeated by the anti-nuke disarmament lobby ever since (regardless of the drop in numbers Perun talked about) and carried on in distorted fashion by the media, especially Hollywood, when nukes and world wars come up. Then throw in the average internet poster&#39;s intelligence (lol), and you get &quot;OMIGOD, THIS WILL CAUSE WW3, END OF THE WORLD!!!&quot; attitudes. There is no nuance or rational thought behind it.']"
"Pretty sure we’re going to see a revival of the rod of god in the near future as well as other space based systems. But anyway, more nukes always sounds like a smart solution. After all, if everyone has nukes nobody would dare to attack right? Just look at the US, nearly everyone has or can buy a gun and there’s hardly any violent crimes right?

"Hi Perun, everyone knows a simple school desk is enough protection from a Nuclear Attack. ",35,"['Duck and cover!', 'I thought the point was to protect yourself from the ceiling collapsing from structural damage caused by the shockwave of a (geographically) nearby strike. Obviously if you get a nuke dropped right on you nothing&#39;s going to save you short of a hardened underground bunker. But you can minimize loss of life, since the effects of a nuclear blast are not uniform.<br><br>I don&#39;t get why some people seem to think that people actually thought a desk would protect from a direct nuclear explosion, it seems very clear to me that that was never the intent.', 'Common Soviet/Russian jokes are<br>- in the event of an nuclear explosion the soldier must hold his service weapon away from his body so that the melting metal would not damages his service boots<br>And<br>- if you are in the open and there is a nuclear detonation, you should assume prone position with your feet towards the blast, cover yourself with a tarp and crawl towards the nearest cemetery', '@Bora Horza Gobuchul That can&#39;t be right.<br>UK doctrine was prone with head towards blast.  Whereupon everything should be fine and you should fill out your report to transmit on your absolutely not fried radio.', 'In 60s and 70s we used to say in multiple West. German located USAF bases that the goal was to get our birds launched and then sit back and die.  Ground forces felt much the same.  We were designed to be the trip wire and knew we were the trip wire and the goal was to absorb as much of Soviet penetration as possible while behind us things were getting organized.<br><br>We had a suicide mission.']"
