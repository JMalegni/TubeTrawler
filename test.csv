The WORST Pokémon Move of Each Type,70026,3230,384
Hey all  this list does include in game situations but I was more thinking in game BATTLES. So yeah  Soak is a great move for false swiping ghosts but it was an honourable mention for in battle situations. And I didn&#39;t include signature moves in this so that&#39;s why no Trick or Treat  Forest&#39;s Curse  Kinesis ETC. <br><br>Thanks everyone for watching &lt;3,88,7
Rock in my opinion has some of the worst moves in general  most of them being low power or low enough accuracy to be a bother to use. I think the type with the best moves is either fire or ice,0,0
Twister is an early game move and you don&#39;t typically get or encounter dragon types in the early game  so I&#39;d say it&#39;s the worst dragon move.,0,0

weedletwineedle uses quite a few of these moves in battles which is so funny,0,0
Tar Shot (Rock Type) lowers target&#39;s speed by 1 and make it weak to fire  until it switches out,0,0
I think it should be spelled with two N’s  but regardless we are brothers in nanner  Nannerneck is really the only thing another great mind would think to name a tropius  lmao noice video I also think there’s plenty of worse dark moves even under your criteria but to each their own,0,0
Idea for &#39;fixing&#39; some of these moves.<br>Grass Whistle; can now target both opponents simultaneously (similar to Dark Void).<br>Inferno; increase base power to 120 (similar to Zap Cannon).<br>Water Sport; increase duration to eight turns and/or damage reduction to 75% and burn immunity<br>Octazooka; increase accuracy to 90% (similar to Leaf Tornado)<br>Brutal Swing; deals more damage the more Pokémon it targets (30 per target)<br>Guard/Power Split; I&#39;ve got nothing. They&#39;re not &#39;good&#39;  but I can&#39;t think of how to &#39;improve&#39; them without utterly changing them<br>Submission; increase base power to 150 (similar to Head Smash)<br>Constrict; this is going to be controversial  but have it function like Gen I&#39;s Wrap in that it prevents a target from using a move (balance it by giving it low accuracy)  conversely  increase base power to 65 and give it a 100% chance to drop speed (similar to Low Sweep)<br>Slam; add a 20% chance to flinch the opponent<br>Razor Wind; increases critical hit ratio by two stages<br>Grudge; reduces the users HP by 1/4 and removes ALL PP from the users last move<br>Gear Up; increases ALL stats of a Pokémon with Plus or Minus  but can only be used once per switch in<br>Steel Roller; increase base power to 150<br>Aromatic Mist; increases the Special Defense of both the user and the ally<br>Flower Shield; increases Defense and Special Defense of all Grass type Pokémon by one stage<br>Dragon Rush; if the move misses  increases speed by one stage<br>Mud Sport; increase duration to eight turns and/or damage reduction to 75% and paralysis immunity<br>Rototiller; increases the Attack and and Special Attack of all grounded Grass type Pokémon by one stage  and by two stages if Grassy Terrain is active<br>Rock Throw; has a 10% chance to flinch and a 10% chance to crit<br>Mirror Move; just make it a copy of Copycat<br>Magnetic Flux; sharply increases Special Attack  Special Defense  and Speed of a Pokémon with Plus or Minus  but can only be used once per switch in<br>Electrify; is not affected by an allies Lightning Rod ability (and better distribution) allowing it to work like a more comprehensive Ion Deluge but not have priority<br>Venom Drench; sharply lowers a Poisoned opponents Attack  Special Attack  and Speed<br>Spider Web; I feel like if you buff this one  you&#39;ll have to buff it&#39;s counterparts  Block and Mean Look as well. Perhaps to make them unique; Block prevents escape and lowers the target&#39;s Speed  Mean Look prevents escape and lowers the target&#39;s Attack  and Spider Web could prevents escape and cause the target to move last it&#39;s priority bracket<br>Mist; increase duration to eight turns or allow it to prevent self-inflicted stat changes,0,0
Honestly worst grass move should be worry seed. It shuts off sleep on an opponent and grass pokemon like to use sleep inducing moves. Grass Whistle at least bypasses substitutes and will do something you want when it&#39;s successful. Worry seed anti synergy and it&#39;s competitive strengths are lacking.<br>I also think Quash or Memento are way less usable then Brutal Swing<br>But thats my opinion and I think I follow your logic in the video well : ),0,1
Honestly mist might have been on my team early game  but not much later than that.,0,1
Another reason to not use submission: <b>brick break.</b>,0,1
&quot;dragon rush is the worst dragon move&quot;<br><b>dragon rage left the chat</b>,0,0
My choice for worst normal move is cut  just because of how frustrating it is. You just have to waste a moveslot for the entire game on this useless normal type attack that is outclassed only a couple.minutes after you get it.,0,0
twister was so bad he forgot about it,0,2
There is a dark type move called snatch which is so bad,0,0
Why bother with water sport when rain is a thing...,0,0
A little shallow in analysis here. Soak has some really cool  albeit niche  uses in doubles. Guard swap makes Chansey+Shuckle absolutely terrifying in doubles as well,0,0
i think synchronoise is the worst objectively. it can ONLY hit mons of the same type as the user  which is already limiting  which also means if it is used as stab it basically becomes a 60 base power move only effective in same type mus  and some pokemon like umbreon cant even use it,0,0
Soak is actually pretty good  it rarely comes into play into normal conditions but it often gets banned in additional metagames like hackmons  turns out most water types arent great at hitting mono water opponents  and gamefreak doesnt give it to the ones that can like ludicolo,0,0
Fun fact: In gen 1  Rock Throw was 65% accurate!,0,0
Razor wind fix: make the 1st turn charge act like protect and damages if attacked physically,0,1
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb4UKeyAzXU&amp;t=7m48s"">7:48</a> doesn’t body slam also doubles if it hits a target that used minimized",0,0
Memento will always be my least favorite move.<br><br>It&#39;s a Dark-Type move where if your Pokémon uses it  it&#39;ll sharply lower the foe&#39;s Attack and Special Attack  then the user faints,0,0
Memento is a worse move. The user faints and lowers the opponents stats. Meanwhile they can just switch to a new mon and your down one,0,0
I figured rock type had the least because i tried to use lycanrock in gen 9 and it gets hardly any good moves,0,0
How is Dragon Rush the worst Dragon type move when Dragon Rage exists?,0,0
water sport&#39;s effect is basically rain but worse .,0,0
I never use blizzard  thunder  etc. They hit not good. I use more thunderbolt  flamethrower etc.,0,0
Powder is an honorable mention because you needed to use it on a non-grass type without safety goggles or the overcoat ability  and it only deals even decent damage if the opponent uses a fire move that turn.<br><br>Honorable mention because it&#39;s not available in gen 9  and the two bug-types that could learn it would lure in fire types (and would love a chance to use quiver dance).,0,0
for normal i wouldve chose mega punch and mega kick.,0,1
damn no pin missle?,0,0
Struggle is simultaneously the best and worst ??? type move.,1,0
Nah  the worse move is focus blast  because it misses every time it has the chance to do something useful  but it&#39;s 100% accurate on 4x resist switch-ins,0,0
i would like to propose an alternative worst dark type move in flatter. it&#39;s the special attack boosting counterpart to swagger  but the issue with that is that it completely defeats the purpose of what swagger&#39;s entire gimmick is. when swagger is used  the target has their attack raised sharply  but also becomes confused.<br><br>according to bulbapedia  &quot;confusion damage is calculated as if it were a typeless physical move with a power of 40.&quot; this means that the attack boost from swagger will increase confusion damage. this is not the case with flatter  since it raises special attack. while swagger has the interesting gimmick of &quot;is my opponent going to knock themself out or did i just set them up for a clean sweep&quot;  flatter is essentially a confuse ray that also gives the target a free nasty plot  which i feel is worse than a move like brutal swing.<br><br>brutal swing can at least have some utility in triggering an ally&#39;s ability like justified  weak armor  rattled  etc  or the weakness policy item  while the only way i can think of that would make flatter worthwhile is using it on an ally with own tempo but that is just a single niche usage  which makes brutal swing look incredible in comparison.<br><br>tl;dr: flatter is literally useless and it is definitely my most hated move,0,1
Additionally splash became less applicable as a worst move in gen 7 when they made a z-move that uses it,0,0
i call your rock throw  and raise head smash<br>great power (150)  okay<br>80% accuracy  that won&#39;t hit ever...<br>recoil damage  that just makes it worse<br>5 PP  you aren&#39;t doing reliably<br><br>and Sonic Boom for normal<br>90% accuracy  kinda mid<br>only deals 20 dmg (unresisted  but who cares)<br>literally a worse dragon rage (40 dmg) and that can&#39;t even hit fairy types,1,0
GUYS  I I THINK VENUSUAR WAS ON THOSE LEECH SE-,0,0
I think grass whistle is better than absorb since it has a niche as a sleep move that beats safety goggles,0,0
Water Sport and Soak are really good in doubles  and Soak removes the opponent&#39;s STAB in addition to making them more weak against you.<br>Steel Roller is a good backup move in competitive play to use against players who rely on terrain.,1,0
supersonic is sht incarnate,0,0
Bide,0,0
Spider Web singlehandedly took Masquerain and Ribombee to Ubers so it&#39;s definitely not the worst. Hell in the new UUbers tier <b>Cutiefly</b> is used because of it<br><br>Edit: lol I&#39;m a sleepy idiot sticky web is the good move spider web is trash,0,2
Curse is by far the worst ??? Type move in the game let&#39;s be honest.,0,1
Brutal swing was a move that originally started off in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series.  It hit a radius of around 3 wide 2 long with the potential to hit 6 Pokémon at once and it cut corners which was actually a pretty good cheese move. It was relatively good early move from what I remember. It was added and it ruined the general utility of it once they removed it from that grid based system.,0,0
you can tell this guy never played vgc for sure,0,1
I think Poison Gas pre-Gen 5 should get an honourable mention as the worst Poison move; 55% accuracy for just the effect to poison a target is terrible. Early game you’re probably better off fishing for a poison from Poison Sting or Poison Point  and mid to late game Toxic is just 100x better in every regard,0,0
even the effect of water sport is just outclassed by rain dance  which many water types learn anyways,0,0
The best type is the bug type. Just altogether. It’s the strongest type ever created and dominates the competitive  casual  and card scenes. It’s the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. All hail bug types.,0,0
I&#39;m kind of surprised Splash isn&#39;t the worst move for Normal types given it flat has zero benefits in any way. No attack  no status or effect  it&#39;s mainly just to fill the slot for a Pokémon meant to be comically seen as the weakest Pokémon ever. It is a comical move for Magikarp  but you&#39;d at least have a reason to use other moves like Constrict  Slam or Razor Wind  them &amp; more being attacks. Shitty attacks  but at least they do something  anything  unlike Splash.,0,1
I guessed an impressive amount of these worst moves right,0,0
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb4UKeyAzXU&amp;t=16m58s"">16:58</a> “and then we have acid  another basic move” made me laugh a bit too much (i’m a chem major)",0,0
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb4UKeyAzXU&amp;t=3m18s"">3:18</a> Even in that very niche scenario I could accomplish the same thing with rain dance and comes with the added benefit of activating swift swim and powering up water moves.",0,0
dark should have been quash tbh,0,0
Worst part with Slam is you don&#39;t even have to compare it to body slam<br>STRENGTH is 80 base power  100% accuracy  with no secondary effect  that is a required HM move in most games  AND you usually get it near when pokemon would learn slam anyways. Completely outclassed since Gen 1,0,0
I don&#39;t think Venom Drench is a bad move  let alone deserving of the title of worst Poison move. I admit it may be better to use Hex in a main game situation  but in a game like Pokémon Reborn where there&#39;s actual difficulty  Venom Drench is extremely useful. Toxapex with Toxic  Venom Drench  Recover and Baneful Bunker can single-handedly take on 2  3  4 pokémon simply because of Venom Drench. <br>To anyone who has played Reborn: this comment is specifically directed at you  Saphira.,1,2
Mirror move was completely broken in pmd,0,0
I cant believe you didn&#39;t say rolling kick for fighting type.,0,1
Quash is a worse dark type move because it forces the target to move last.,1,0
its sad how conkeldurrs community day move in GO was brutal swing that was kinda brutal ngl,0,0
Water Sport even after its buff is just an extremely bad version of Rain Dance. <br><br>The only difference is that Water Sport doesn&#39;t get cancelled out when a weather setter comes in  which is not really an upside since rain can cancel other weather effects in turn  giving it more utility.,0,0
Great video! Keep it up. Am actually working on a fangame and I&#39;m planning on buffing a lot of bad moves  so this video provided me with a lot of good ideas on which ones need a buff.,0,2
Interestingly enough  the romhack Pokémon Clover has a Pokémon called Sesquatch which is prety unique because of its signature ability :&quot;Suddenly&quot;.<br>It&#39;s an ability that acts like a permanent Power Herb  letting you do both phases of a charging move in the same turn. Despite Sesquatch having middling stats  it has awesome typing (Normal/Ghost: 3 immunities and only weak to Dark) and its moveset includes Skull Bash  meaning it can spam a very powerful STAB while constantly buffing its own defense. One of the best Mons ever.<br><br>Back on topic  I guess Sesquatch COULD make use of Razor Wind...if it didn&#39;t already have access to Skull Bash which hits harder and has a useful extra effect of raising defense.,0,1
Honestly thought dragon rage would be on here since it can only do 40 damage and the chances of getting a dragon mon early enough to where 40 is a significant number is slim to none,0,0
Soak is unironically a great move  sad to see it included— put it on a Smeargle with Spore and False Swipe and you’ve got the ultimate catching pokemon,0,0
Power split has a <b>minimal</b> amount of merit in my eyes. Why?<br><br><br>Shuckle gets it.<br><br>Give your Shuckle minimal<br>Attack &amp; Special Attack  use Power Swap  you now have decent offenses &amp; the opponent has crappy offenses.,0,0
Believe it or not  Dragon Rush has a small niche against Minimize as it will never miss against the target and does double damage<br><br>Even Heavy Slam has this same mechanic,0,0
For me  Poison moves have honorable mentions for the worst with: <br><br>Belch: I just don&#39;t like the fact you have to use a Berry  or it&#39;s useless otherwise  or if anything stops you from eating your berry like Knock Off or Unnerve. <br>Poison Powder: At 75% accuracy its a bad move for just a guaranteed poison  especially when until like this current generation almost everything learned Toxic instead. <br>Poison Tail: At 50 power its a very mid move when normally if you need it Poison Jab is usually available and does the same thing  but better.,0,1
I think kinesis is a far worse psychic move,0,1
bet another lit pokémon tuber i’m so hyped. for me it’s just you freezai jimothy cool and aim. i’m so excited to have a number 4 in my roster,0,1
No mention of Psywave?,0,0
I don&#39;t agree on Venom Drench being the worst Poison-type move. Belch is significantly worse in my opinion.,0,0
I still wish there was a mon with No Guard or even possibly Compound Lens mon that can use Zap Cannon/Inferno. Imagine if it was a Electric and Fire special attacker.,1,0
Steel roller is actually pretty good for catching Xerneas in a dynamax adventure  not much use besides that but it makes it far better than any other move in this video,3,0
i think quash is a worse move than brutal swing,0,0
For grass i wouldve probably chosen vine whip over absorb as being worse because of the pathetic pp it has in exchange to the other elements. Fire gets ember and water gets water gun each with 25pp and to add insult to injury it has 35 base power instead of 40 like the other elements. Even bubble makes up for its low power with high pp  secondary effect  and multitargeting in doubles. Vine whip i think did get a buff at some point but idk what recent gen that was if it did.,0,0
I&#39;m interested in seeing you fix the worst moves,0,0
You know I never used venom drench before  but it was amazing against totem Lurantis in prismatic moon romhack so seeing it here is funny.,0,0
Steel roller was actually decent cuz of the tapus at the time,0,0
Submission will always be Smash type,0,0
I used Venom Drench Toxic Spikes/Baneful Bunker Venoshock Recover with a Merciless Toxapex in my SW Nuzlocke and it was clutch when there weren’t any Poison or Steel Pokémon on the field. Venom Drench is an extremely powerful debuff move when used in conjunction with Toxic Spikes. When the opponent was too bulky for my Toxapex to take out with an OHKO  or strong enough that it could two-shot  spamming Venom Drench and Recover was my saviour. Carried me through most to the mid-game to end-game. <br><br>The real worst poison moves are Corrosive Gas  which takes away the targets Item  and the signature move of Pyukumuku  which is just recover that can only activate if you have a status condition (it also heals the status condition).,2,1
Dishonorable mentions: Fury Atk  Fury Swipes  Spike Cannon  Present  Captivate  Laser Focus  Screech  Heal Block  Toxic Thread.<br>I always get confused between Mind Reader &amp; Miracle Eye. Metal Sound actually can be paired up w Throat Spray to cause massive Special damage which is smth that can&#39;t be replicated by the physical variant Screech. Toxic Thread could so much more by being Toxic + . Psychic Noise is gonna be replacing Heal Block. Idk if even Loaded Dice can save Fury Swipes. &amp; only Cloyster may consider Spike Cannon if only it offered what its other moves don&#39;t.,0,0
what&#39;s the name of the music used in the first bit of the video? reminds me of casiopea,0,0
You guys know any slept on pokemon in gen 9 ou? I’ve been using grimsnarl and it’s honestly underrated,0,0
Brutal swing is actually pretty useful in doubles to self Activate a Weakness Policy on a Dark Weak mon. I wouldnt call a move bad only cause it does Low damage. I guess in Singles its pretty useless but Doubles are a part of the games aswell,0,0
Interesting video  it&#39;s the first of its kind I&#39;ve seen. But I have some disagreements. .<br>WATER : The worst move is clearly the hateful Hydro pump. Only 80%  for 5 PP   and to worse was nerfed to 120 to 110 base power. Man  Water Sport at least. At least Water Sport it&#39;s trustworthy .<br>NORMAL : You forgot of the Doubleslap  but it&#39;s fine. A forgotable past move.<br>PSYCHIC : For me   the worst move is Psywave( worst than hypnosis even ). The damage simply varies between %50 and 150% based on the opponent&#39;s level. It&#39;s simpler to give it a night shade or seismic toss,0,0
For poison I want to make a defense that belch is the worst move because you have to eat a berry before using it so you only really get one chance to use it most of the time,0,0
Soak is definitely a double battlee attack not singles. <br><br>That being said  it&#39;s definitely a meme tactic. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t say horrible.  though.,0,1
I’m pretty sure Mienshao doesn’t get Technician  so it doesn’t really take advantage of brutal swing,0,0
i&#39;m surprised Quash wasn&#39;t the move used for Dark Type,1,0
Grass Whistle is the only sleep-inducing Grass-type move that can affect Grass types. It was absolutely pivotal in my run of Alpha Sapphire where I ran a monotype Grass team where I limited myself to only Grass-type moves.,4,0
Bro surely ember is worse then inferno,0,0
doesn&#39;t quite compare to venom drench  but i&#39;d give an honourable mention to poison powder. it has 75% accuracy  grass (+ goggles) and poison types are immune  it hits both foes but also your ally. it&#39;s just outclassed by poison gas and toxic. it&#39;s not even worth using early game since you can poison with poison attacks anyway,1,0
Type trio&#39;s:<br><br>Grass/Fire/Water<br>Normal/Fighting/Flying<br>Electric/Poison/Ice<br>Rock/Ground/Steel<br>Psychic/Ghost/Dark<br>Bug/Dragon/Fairy,0,0
Dragon Rage????,0,0
Does competitively mean VGC  the official competitive format  or single battles? Because soak has actually seen some decent usage there  as a fast support partner Pokemon can turn an enemy to water to make them take super effective damage from their stronger partner Pokemon,0,1
I’m curious why you didn’t choose sandstorm for Rock. Despite being beneficial  no one actually uses it with a move slot and rather uses a sand stream user instead.,1,1
If you make a best moves of every type then I only ask that you remember that Thousans Arrows is a move that exists.<br><br>Really cool video :),1,1
I dont think Brutal Swing is a bad move  its a physical all target move with 90power base (stab). Fake Tears is worse.,0,0
Actually  the worst normal type move (in Gen 1 specifically) is Focus energy.  They screwed up the programming and it ends up cutting your Crit rate in Half. At least Constrict does minor amounts of damage.,6,0
Im surprised you didn&#39;t even mention Magic Room  the psychic type move that turns off items. Useless in the single player since you&#39;ll have items equipped more often then your opponents and I have never seen anyone use it in competitive play  either in doubles or singles.,0,1
I actually had a niche soak strat in gen 8 DOU. I ran regeleki and a scarfed tapu fini with soak. Soak a opponent before anyone can move  nuke with regieleki,1,0
ive tried so hard to make a wonder room team work but theres just no reason to stack only physical or special attackers and burn a turn  moveslot and potentially entire pokemon just to cover for 1 or 2 walls max. only genuine use might be in closed team sheet doubles to surprise a bulky lead/defensive setup mon staying in with a wonder room&gt;ohko but even then theres infinitely better options,0,0
For me  the worst normal move is Bide. Giving your opponent two free turns before you can deal damage is a terrible deal,2,2
One of my favorite doubles combos in gen 7 is Malamar + Aegislash. King&#39;s Shield + Brutal Swing  Malamar gets a sharp boost to attack due to Contrary then it hits the opponents,2,0
All that needs to happen for electrify is to be given to a pokemon with lightningrod  volt absorb or a fast ground type and it suddenly has the power to become very busted,0,0
I am surprised you didnt mention how rock throw only has 90% accuracy despite only having 40 base power  having less pp than tackle  and with absolutely no secondary effect. this move is needlessly bad  even for early game,2,0
Wait wait wait  that steel type honorable mention sounded really good. Aren’t there a lot of teams that rely on setting up terrain? Misty terrain teams especially would be screwed.,1,2
havent even watched 2 minutes and you could not make worse decisions,0,4
Gen 5 incinerate is very much a bad move. Low bp to the point where even with super effective damage you’d prefer stab options available at the same time weak effect and you need to buy it with bp which can take a while and spending all that time to get it of all things would be a massive waste,0,0
Not me building a pvp team with almost all of the moves mentioned in this vid ,1,1
Damn this video was so half assed that most types already have a comment that proposes a better move  &quot;don&#39;t recommend this channel&quot;,0,1
i have actually used defense curl + rollout in a playthroughs  but i would never use stone edge because of the annoying accuracy,0,1
Ahhh yes  gen 1 submission.... what a load of crap. and back then  fighting was only good against normal  rock and ice. Even if you could use submission to damage a defensive normal or rock type  you would sewerslide by taking all that recoil. <br>In gen 2  they absolutely did not fix things with cross chop  the hydro pump of the fighting world. It gained strengths against dark and steel at least....,0,0
Id say twister is the worst dragon move  cos hardly any early game mons get it (horsea maybe?) and there are barely any dragon type enemies in the early game to take advantage of with it anyway,0,0
I think Toxic Thread is the worst Poison type move. It&#39;s only learned by Ariados and Spinarak  and its effect is it poisons and reduces speed by one stage.,1,0
I think the worst Dragon type move is Dragon Rage  it’s power locked into 40 power based  no benefit from stab and crits at all<br>at least Dragon Rush can be useful despite the accuracy,2,1
I&#39;d say Twister is the worst Dragon type move. Sure  some Pokémon get it early on  but most Pokémon that get it early aren&#39;t Dragon type and don&#39;t need the coverage because Dragon isn&#39;t super effective against anything except itself.,0,0
I think the worst Normal type move could be Trump Card. Its base power depends on how much PP you have. The less PP  the higher the base power. It starts off really weak and really doesn&#39;t have anything going for it.,2,2
A lot of these moves are good in doubles though,1,1
What about dragon rage?,0,1
Things like Water Sport I think we&#39;re just put in tk make Doubles have extra ways about things. So if you have a soggy Mon and a leafy Mon. It could work. But it&#39;s way more hassle than it needs be.,0,1
Mist is good in one situation. A mono water type nuzlocke of Emerald,1,0
NGL never knew what mist did  been playing Pokemon since the 90s,0,0
another argument for rock throw being the worst  is by the time rock throw becomes usable  rock tomb is basically accessible in EVERY game its released in  making rock throw even MORE useless.,2,0
Power split is pretty good on araquanid  since it has low attack but an ability that doubles the damage of water moves. Ypu can come in on high attack mons and cripple them whil making yourself stronger,7,0
Personally  I&#39;d say that Poison Powder is the worst Poison inflicting move.<br>All the Pokemon that can learn it can also learn Stun Sport and Sleep Powder.<br>And there’s the existence of Toxic which makes Poison Powder obsolete.,1,2
"need to know what track you used at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb4UKeyAzXU&amp;t=6m03s"">6:03</a> please!",0,2
The ONLY way I could see Grudge being useful (and having an edge over Destiny Bond) is that if the opponent relies heavily on that one move they used to KO you with  so they&#39;d be useless after you die or at least would have to switch out  giving you a &quot;free&quot; turn  but that&#39;s so many conditions for such a mediocre (thought not small - gaining momentum is very good in Pokemon battles) benefit.,1,3
Power Split is funny with Shuckle. :),0,0
I&#39;m surprised to not see Imprison on here! It requires you to share a move with the opponent  and then use it knowing you share the move. Super situational!,2,4
I think that normal has the best and worst moves  as splash isn&#39;t very good  gut there are some broken normal moves such as revival blessing. I think that grass is a close second as it&#39;s got spore and spiky shield which are both very good moves. If we are considering gen 5 dark void  dark would have the best moves because of how broken dark void is  but I think that normal takes the cake in the end because of the types&#39; utility.,0,0
Imo fire has the best moves because you got stuff like will-o-wisp but dark is also good because its got knock off,1,1
i don&#39;t think the constant giphy transitions are very fitting,0,0
brutal swing in pokemon go is really good for pvp so its not entirely bad ,1,1
Cool vid; I&#39;m waiting for the one with good moves,0,0
I come in here for the first time and don&#39;t really have a strong opinion on most of them but fighting type&#39;s worst move has to be Submission,0,0
I knew it was Grass Whistile immediately. Thing is trash.,1,0
One thing I&#39;d change is setting fighting&#39;s worst move to high jump kick. It&#39;s had so many changes over the years but I always remember pokemon throwing themselves into a wall and dying when they tried to land that attack.,0,1
I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t mention the fact Rain just makes Water Sport is obsolete since it does the same thing + boost Water type attacks,1,1
Bro said Inferno like Fire Spin isn&#39;t right there,0,1
Y&#39;know  I think having an ability that just deploys 3 to 5 turns of mist when the Pokémon comes out would be a super great ability.  Nobody is going to spend a 4th of their move slots on mist but it&#39;s not an awful move. I can see ice types and ghosts getting an ability like that.,49,4
Wait. What about Body check? It is just Slam with recoil...,0,2

My thoughts for the best move of each type. Most of these moves are considered essential to the Pokémon’s moveset for the Pokémon that learn them  either in a competitive sense or for a play through <br><br>Normal: Extreme speed  baton pass  protect <br>Fire: eruption<br>Water: scald<br>Electric: thunderbolt<br>Grass: spore<br>Ice: Aurora veil  ice beam<br>Fighting: close combat<br>Ground: earthquake <br>Flying: tailwind  fly<br>Bug: quiver dance  u-turn<br>Rock: stealth rock<br>Ghost: shadow ball<br>Dragon: dragon dance <br>Dark: knock off<br>Steel: heavy slam<br>Fairy: dazzling gleam<br>Poison: toxic <br>Psychic: light screen  reflect,2,2
I think Fire has the best moves imo  since literally all of them have a secondary effect of some sort.<br>The type with the worst moves has to be Rock. Literally the most inaccurate type having only like 3 Perfectly accurate moves [with the exception of Status and Signature moves] makes it a gamble to use,4,4
Soak actually helped me a lot with pyuku up to gen 8 AG,2,0
Im going to be honest  while Soak isnt a great move and really isnt good I do think it is a bit better than it got credit for here. Yeah the effect only lasts until the opponent switches but if you go for toxic on a steel type then they&#39;re going to still be poisoned when they swap in. And unlike trick or treat and forrest&#39;s curse  it doesn&#39;t add the type but also removes all the other types from the opponent&#39;s pokemon meaning they lose access to their usual STAB options. Which is just a little off of effectively going -1 when using STAB. I would also assume that it causes Salt Cure to do extra damage as they become water type. So there&#39;s at least a couple niches that the attack has  and Im not saying its even good  but I dont think its a contender for worst water move.,1,1
Inferno is pretty fun with Blunder Policy,1,0
as a shuckle user  I think power split and guard split are great moves,5,0
ok for dark I would pick embargo. this stops the opponent from receiving held item effects for 5 turns. Brutal swing can be used to activate weakness policies in doubles so I think it&#39;s more useful,3,4
Ive used Inferno Torkoal on my sv gravity team,1,1
Just some stuff I could think of from the top of my head:<br><br>Z grass whistle is used for niche pokemon&#39;s sweep for youtube content  although there&#39;s no Z move anymore<br><br>Brutal swing was used to activate weakness policy on actual strong teams<br>Also moves like embargo exist if we also count mud sport and all<br><br>I think magic room should have a honorable mention-what do you think<br><br>Aruguably Halloween is worse than grudge maybe,6,0
What makes Watersport worse is that rain does the same thing  but with other benefits,2,1

Just now learning that magnetic flux and gear up are moves that exist  funny how Gamefreak keeps adding gimmicks around plus/minus over multiple gens but makes them all terrible,1,0
brutal swing pretty nice for self proc-ing weakness policy in doubles,1,0
Soak is actually fairly useful  at least  on Smeargle  when trying to catch hard to get pokemon  I generally have a Smeargle with the moveset False Swipe  Spore  Soak  and another higher power but non-stab/above 100 power move. This way I can use soak to get rid of ghost types immunity to false swipe  and grass types immunity to spore.,6,0
Man  it really goes to show how bad a move can be when it was the signature move of a pokemon  but you had no idea it existed at all,0,0
If we include signature moves  i say kyurem’s 2 (of 3) signature ice type moves are the worst for the type  ice burn and freeze shock. Not only are they 2 turn charging moves that don’t give any benefits while charging  they’re 90% accurate which means they can still miss  wasting 2 turns. the only use freeze shock had was in gen 7 for the ice type Z move on kyurem black for a powerful one time physical ice type move. so i give the title of worse ice type move to ice burn because ice beam and blizzard exists.,1,1
Which type has the worst moves? I would probably nominate rock...its strongest STAB has 80% accuracy  with 100 base power  otherwise you get 90% accuracy with 75 base power.  Fun...  Special rock moves have non existent distribution  or poor power  and with so many people outside the rock type getting stealth rock... yeah.  <br><br>Probably one of the bigger reasons why rock is one of the worst  if not the worst types  alongside the rock type pokemon itself being bulky mons with low speed  despite it being a glass cannon sort of type  and with the typing itself struggling with offense with its bad movepool  it&#39;s not a good situation for the type.<br><br>The type with the best moves is more difficult  I&#39;ll probably nominate water just because it has so many secondary effects/priority  aqua jet  scald that allows water types to burn enemies better than FIRE TYPES  waterfall&#39;s flinching  flip turn&#39;s pivoting  but fire  dragon  and fighting also have a great movepool  and dark has some great utility with their moves.,0,1
Most of these are viewed through the gen 9 point of view  not necessarily when they were introduced.,4,1
So we&#39;re all just gonna act like Banette wasn&#39;t showing us her Mega Banetties in the thumbnail?!,2,1
I loved using brutal swing Zacian to murder Lunala and Calyrex-S in SS VGC.,1,0
Im actually going to throw Smart Strike under the bus because Steel Roller could see use as a counter pick against the Tapus but Smart Strike has only one effect  it cant miss like Aerial Ace  now thats not terrible BUT Smart Strike really struggles with distributon. Its not given to many pokemon and most of them arent actually Steel Type  meaning its a coverage option  but Steel Type isnt actually that good offensivly.,0,3
Rock is easily the type that’s asking for a consistent move. Gamefreak refuses to give us a good 100% accurate rock attack but said “what if you get hit with a rock attack every time you switch in ,2,2
its pretty rare that i fully agree with these videos but i actually agreed with basically everything,1,1
I thought poison was going to be belch,0,1
I&#39;m surprised that Quash wasn&#39;t the pick for Dark type moves,4,1
Hey all  this list does include in game situations but I was more thinking in game BATTLES. So yeah  Soak is a great move for false swiping ghosts but it was an honourable mention for in battle situations. And I didn&#39;t include signature moves in this so that&#39;s why no Trick or Treat  Forest&#39;s Curse  Kinesis ETC. <br><br>Thanks everyone for watching &lt;3,88,7
Wait  Grass Whistle can be stopped by Sap Sipper? How does that even work? How do you <i>drink</i> sound? I get it&#39;s like a type-encompassing thing  but that just feels odd,1,2
My favorite part of competitive Pokemon  is that a lot of “bad” moves can find a powerful niche with the right team.,36,4
Nerd moment: Soak has a really small niche use! It can be used on ghost pokemon to make them able to be false swiped! Yeah  nothing incredible  but a niche lmao,1,1
Soak has been a really good in some VGC formats. Mostly because it can make your own Shedinja a win condition more easily,6,0

I dont think soak should be a honorable mention as it is very useful for catching. Ghost types and removing stab from powerful mons are useful in situations such as shiny hunting,4,0

Grass- Forest curse has literally no practical application. Sleep is a good status  just why does this move exist tho?<br>Dark- Embargo Brutal swing at least multiple vgc applications for weakness policy users  specifically in vgc restricted formats or with metagross in gen 8. Embargo prevents held items  but goes away on switch and only hits one enemy. Gj  you made lefties stop working for a turn  now they switched out and u did nothing.<br>Psychic- Kinesis 80 accuracy worse sand attack that doesnt work on dark types  and it only works on alakazam and kadabra  who are super squishy and cant afford to use this move.<br>Normal- If we are counting gen 1 moves  then rage is it easily. Its thrash  but u can never do anything else ever again  and its 20 base power. Its way worse than even constrict  because even though its low bp  u can at least do other stuff after  and it has a lot of pp or something so u can pp stall.<br>Ghost- Trick-or-treat. I think all these type changing/adding moves suck  and this one is no different. <br>Twister- The main mons that get this early are flying types and &quot;flying types&quot; like gyarados. Most dragon types get dragon claw  dual chop  or dragon breath equally early  or earlier  so its outclassed and garbage  that will only be used early on dragons  who are usually going to be caught levels 30+.<br>Electric- I agree with magnetic flux  but this move is broken with some strats. This is cuz a fast mon with this move that can have an electric absorb ability can become unhittable  and is banned in a lot of OMs because of this.<br>Purify- Rip only works on other mons  doubles only move  only works with pyukumuku  bruh this move baited everyone at least once.<br>Everything else i agree with  cool video<br>P.S.  you put electric for ground.,0,1

Despite having an actual good secondary effect  I think Skitter Smack would be a good candidate for the worst Bug type move  this was introduced in Sword/Shield alongside other amazing moves like Triple Axel  Corrosive Gas or Burning Jealously  but this move doesnt really have any particular use.<br>Bug coverage isnt very good  and even then  the move is 70 bp and 90% acc  and all bug types that learn it have better options on Leech Life  X-Scissor or Bug Buzz.,7,2

Razor Wind gotta be the worst move in the game fr. It’s a charging move for crying out loud. It’s base power should be at LEAST 130 ,0,0

Fun fact: If umbreon uses synchronoise  it will always fail  either because:<br>1- The target isnt dark type so it&#39;s type is different than umbreon&#39;s<br>2- The target is dark type  so the attack should work  but synchronoise is a psychic type move so it fails anyway,362,9
