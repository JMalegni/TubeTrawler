cool stuff,0,0
I would love to see a review of Timeshift from you,0,0
i honestly love the penumbra series so much. That tactile physical way of interacting with the world  deliberately clunky and heavy but super immersive  the way it feels more grounded than Amnesia&#39;s more fantastical premise  the environmental design and puzzles  it is simply something I&#39;ve not found elsewhere.<br><br>The first two in particular lodged in my mind and i get super excited anytime a game uses these core mechanics or derivatives of them.,2,0
Heard lot about this series over the years  but each time I&#39;ve watched some gameplay to decide whether to play it or not  it kinda threw me off each time. At least now I precisely know what I missed,0,0

[spoilers] i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s intentional but i like how at the end of black plague  philip decides to sacrifice himself for what he perceives as the good of humanity. this contrasts with his earlier  individualistic decision to refuse his father&#39;s request and investigate the facility. so basically philip screws the tuurngait over both individually and collectively. bad call trusting that one. sorry fellas.,0,0
I don&#39;t even like horror games (can&#39;t even get through amnesia by myself) but I LOVE penumbra. It may be because it&#39;s generally slower  and the enemies (even in black plague) are pretty easy to avoid or run from. I played penumbra despite the enemies  not because of them. Amnesia felt like they really wanted to player to play around their enemies and the story and atmosphere suffers because of it. The atmosphere in penumbra is creepy and haunting  the atmosphere in amnesia goes is everything from stellar gothic horror to really janky survival horror.,0,0

I made my friend play this with me in a dark room as a kid  specifically Black Plague. While he was in the room just before the first monster  and he was initially scared and super focused on the game  I quietly left the chair next to him and hunched in the corner of the room. He got super fucking scared by the enemy  turned to me for support  got super fucking scared by my absence  then saw my ass crouched in the corner of the room staring at him and got even more scared.<br><br>I&#39;ve never gotten anyone so bad before or since  and I&#39;m 30.,0,0

I honestly thought Clarence ruined Black Plague. You went from the effective as hell isolated dread of Overture  to some Ratzo Rizzo mook constantly trying to be the comic relief like the wise cracking hacker buddy in a late 90s FPS. It&#39;s a shame because EVERYTHING about the graphics and gameplay in Black Plague was improved over Overture.,0,0
I loved the Penumbra games when I was younger. Watched the trailer one time and played it from a demo disc and was hooked and spooked. Genuinely one of the first horror games I played at the time that scared me so much I couldn&#39;t sleep at night lol.,1,0

Say Gyatt fanum tax skibidi ohio rizzler right now or i’m unsubscribing,0,0
Personally  the clunky combat in Overture added a lot of oldschool survival-horror tension that is completely deflated with its removal in Black Plague - before  knowing dogs were around was always a fight or flight affair that made me pay attention to the environment  but now with the grey zombies I knew I was always shoehorned into stealth/evasion and <b>hypothetically</b> should simply reload if spotted  but the gameplay was also further streamlined to facilitate escape (plus the zombie AI was so braindead) that for the most part one could just walk away.<br><br>Clarence was also an intriguing concept but I found his voice too cartoonish to take seriously  which only compounded the goofy ass zombie stealth gameplay. Red was a real one.,0,0

I bought the Penumbra games for like $2 or 3 at the time. I had time off and was bored. Turned into one of my favorite horror games ever. Glad to see it coming back into the limelight,0,0
The Penumbra games definitely deserve more love  but man  that reference to Infra stings. It doesn&#39;t get quite as weird as Penumbra  but I really hope that he comes back to it at some point and doesn&#39;t just leave it at a two-second side mention.,0,0
to me actually the graphics were pretty good. The contrast  the colors were all top tier in contrast to many other games  not to mention the amosphere. Severly underrated game.,0,0
I remember playing the tech demo for Penumbra back in 06 I think it was. I was clamoring for a great interactive horror game and was really impressed with the physicality of the interactions  sounds and atmosphere. Found a physical copy of Overture as a moody teen and played it through a good 4 or 5 times :). It&#39;s strange to think how long ago it all was... How Amnesia would rocket the let&#39;s play trend  how Youtube celebrities had risen to fame by playing those games. It all felt so niche back then.,1,0
Frictional is a company where I sign up every time. Even when they&#39;re not at their best they&#39;re at least interesting. Naturally this means if Mandalore reviews the Penumbra games  I show up fast.<br>Thank you and more please. :),0,0

Why an eye ? <br>After like 11-12 year later now I know what that game is <br>But I guess if I was able to play it when I was like still young I would&#39;ve probably never finished the game cuz I would&#39;ve too busy shitting my pants ...

This take on a hivemind was so refreshing. The hivemind wasn&#39;t inherently hostile (allegedly)   but the protagonist also wasn&#39;t some misanthrope dumbass going on about how humans having free will is bad  but you still got a grim  xenophobic ending that players can actually chew on.,0,0

This one had intrigued me the most  I liked it except for the fact that I was pretty young and scared of it&#39;s content.

I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re covering this series. When Amnesia came out I was happy for the developers but I was really disappointed that the Penumbra series got almost no attention whatsoever after Amnesia had its hey-day with lets-players. <br><br>I was a teenager and terrified of horror games  but my first girlfriend loved this series so I wanted to play this and experience it with her. I was pretty quickly hooked and I pushed past my fear of horror games. I find the entire narrative unique  interested  and Red&#39;s character and performance was  and still is  deeply haunting  unsettling  and memorable many years later. The first game is definitely janky and feels primitve by today&#39;s standards but I think Black Plague helps round out a lot of these week points.<br><br>Great series  great story. Thanks for covering one of my favorites!,0,0

You should try Fiend. A freeware game made by Thomas Grip before frictional games. It&#39;s probably the best straight up Mythos horror game I&#39;ve played. Puzzles  limited survival horror combat  a lot of great design decisions in general. A ton of atmosphere. He released it in 2001. I think I played it in 2002 or 2003  long before Frictional Games or even Penumbra. It was obvious even back then this guy had a lot of talent.,0,0

I remember Requiem being disappointing as well  and is better skipped since it has basically no impact on the first two games.  <br><br>The thing I remember most about Requiem is the &#39;donkey kong&#39; puzzle  where you have to jump over barrels while climbing up a scaffolding.

One of my favourite moments is near the end of Black Plague  where you are in dark maze with some infected  and Clarence tells you to take a left (or right  I can&#39;t remember). Now  Clarence has been messing with you the whole time  so you do the opposite of what he says... and end up face-to-face with a monster. It&#39;s such a great &quot;Gotcha!&quot; moment  because even if Clarence can&#39;t be trusted  he&#39;s really afraid of what the others may do to him and was trying to be actually helpful for once.,1,0

Speaking of Dangerous Hunts you reviewed there is Dangerous Hunts 2011  which is also pretty crazy. Not crazy in that you are hunting everything  and everything is hunting you  but in the sense that it has an actual story. Not brothers getting revenge for their father story and learning to he brothers again  but actual science experiments  a paranormal hyena that is cursed and also is a werehyena  and animal mind control. It starts out very similar to the 2013 game  you  your father and brother  out hunting  end up hunting a bear. Only there is this strange whistle which seems to control a bunch of wolves oh and the brother dies this time instead of the father.,0,0
Man  that &quot;everything is dynamic&quot; era in gaming was so awesome  everything moved  physics  lights  yaaay. Not in Penumbra tho  that control scheme was opposite of what devs have aimed for. Instead of intuitive it only complicated stuff even more  making controls feel even more game-y and unimmersive. It&#39;s that same tresspasser&#39;s idiotic idea - make 3D interactions in a strictily 2D medium - your display is 2D and your input method is 2D  translating 2D input to 3D and back only adds more abstraction layers. It only ever works with a proper 3D input devices  it works amazingly in VR.,0,0

Penumbra was the first game to truly gas light me. I remember mapping the area out in my head and then got into a chase with a monster and tried to run through my pre-planned escape route; only to run immediately into a dead end. When I reloaded the save I came back to that area and it was the hallway I remembered. I spent YEARS questioning whether I had taken the wrong turn or if the game had some how changed the environment on me.<br><br>I have never seen a horror game since that actually manipulated doors  hallways  signage  etc to keep you confused and it was done subtly enough that I was never 100% sure it was a mechanic or not.,0,0

Ah  well do I remember Penumbra. I missed how the first game actually let yourself defend yourself with the items you found  which Frictional sadly dropped from later games in a harbinger of the one-trick-ponypocalypse that would befall horror gaming with the proliferation of Amnesia: The Dark Descent.<br><br>Thing is  I LIKED Amnesia 1  but absolute helplessness in horror can be a one-trick-pony  so it can&#39;t outstay its welcome if it wants to remain truly effective  which is something that emulators of Amnesia&#39;s success failed to achieve. But thankfully  Amnesia: The Bunker shows how we can have Frictional&#39;s atmospheric horror while also being able to put a bullet in the bad man. Though in a dark genius twist  you also need the bullets for other things  which is some Fear &amp; Hunger monkey&#39;s paw brilliance.,0,0

People usually like Black Plague more  but I&#39;m more in the Overture camp. It has a lot of mystery &amp; exposition to it  environmental storytelling etc,0,0

Aw this will be bloody good! Im so happy whenever you cover horror stuff and the atmospheres of these games rocks.,2,0
are you gonna do Baldur&#39;s Gate 3?,0,0
Alright how do you know exactly what games I am revisting ? this is like the second game I recently replayed from old timy you covering.<br>Also Amnesia the bunker IS penumbra  with I love  is our lovely small corridors with puzzles and roaming monsters  just one monster in Bunker.,0,0
I replay the penumbra series every Halloween! They&#39;re my favorite puzzle horrors and I honestly like them more than the amnesia games (they&#39;re just above soma for me) I&#39;d love to see them return to the ip or something similar  even if it was just Soma 2 or something,6,0

Holy shit I&#39;ve just played them last month and I was saddened by how little coverage and reviews these games have got on youtube. And Mandalore comes and rectifies it  this series definitely deserves some more love  nice.,20,0

Good god  Mandy  you spoil us!<br>I also loved Black Plague&#39;s puzzles.  The entire first major puzzle involving the coin and soda was really cool to me then and still is now.,0,0
wow honestly? I don&#39;t agree with you maybe it&#39;s just the nostalgia talking  or smth... but necrologue was my favorite? It did feel well correct? I mean the whole clarance thing was a bit scetchy but in hindsight it&#39;s understandable since he was a star of the show. And the ending was satisfying  he betrays tuurngait and makes his escape. Also i think there was one that was called &quot;the visions of the red&quot; where you could play as him saying that he didn&#39;t kill himself but put ash to a tray with a key. That one was fun but got abandoned mid development (i think). I gues if it has the atmosphere of a good game it kinda is? and expectations are lowered since it is the mod? IDK i liked it,0,0
Love how you finally got around to this. Penumbra was really my first look into horror gaming  and some moments  particularly in black plague have honestly stuck with me for years.<br><br>I thought I was over what Clarance made me do. I&#39;m not  that fucker got what he deserved. I think I was too young at the time to really see the set up  but man  the way he warps your perception seems way more apparent now.<br><br>Hope you had a good Thanksgiving,0,0

Never expected you to make videos about Frictional Games but from a recent fan of the studio I&#39;m just happy that they&#39;re gonna be properly reviewed by a good reviewer like you  :),5,0
Penumbra  a.k.a &quot;Amnesia before it was cool&quot;. The game that single-handedly revived the survival horror genre. A true blast from the past!,85,0

The Penumbra tech demo from 2006 was my first ever horror game. It scares the shit out of me as a young teenager. Overture really out me down the road of story driven horror  and I owe a lot of my taste in media to the foundations it built. I was part of their forum from 2008 onwards and loved it a lot.,78,1
Absolutely loved these games!,0,0
You know after playing The Bunker which reminds me a bit of Penumbra  I actually put into question if maybe The Bunker is not just a new Amnesia game  but maybe a prototype to a possible Penumbra: Remake. Like attach the prototype to the Amnesia series and see how people felt about the game and if it shows success then they know that it be worth building more on this with a Penumbra: Remake.,2,0

My father died when I was 13. His last words to me were &quot;Penumbra was a pretty alright game dude&quot;. I spent years pondering on what he meant by this  so thank you  Mangalore. Thank you.,3,0
Ah man  Penumbra was great. I watched Helloween4545 play it back in the day and it immediately got me hooked to play it myself. Wish we&#39;d still get horror games like this.<br>Unfortunately Bunker really didn&#39;t do it for me.,34,6
After watching half a dozen failed &quot;Let&#39;s Plays&quot; on Something Awful  I finally decided to play this myself and I must say I felt proud that I was able to finish this. It was fun  creepy and janky all at the same time.,31,0

The use of an interactive physics engine really puts me in mind of the Jurassic Park game Trespasser. It was an absolute flop of a game but every now and again they come across something in modern gaming that makes me think hmmm  I wonder if the person who made this played trespasser. Could be a good game for a future episode.,86,6

I will never forget how Penumbra 2 created THE scariest moment in a video game of my life. <br>I was a teenager  not overly scared but loving the game  and I was saving the batteries until the end. When I felt things are coming to a close I started using it. The FIRST time I decide to use the flashlight I turn it on expecting to feel less scared now that there&#39;s more light and I turn it on... not seeing how in the corner of the halo I am shining light on the monster... the monster IMMEDIATELY turns around and I SMASHED the Esc button to pause the game and take a 10-minute break ,491,2
