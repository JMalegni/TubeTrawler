Bungie Is Destroying Destiny 2,7535,725,48
I remember getting Destiny free when I bought a Call of Duty game  and they gave me the option to just become max level instantly. Bungie doesn&#39;t seem to have good ideas when it comes to newcomers,0,0

If the green brothers are targeting people I know  do not speak to them or Emily Graslie. And I do not release any videos.<br><br>The Green Brothers are targeting people who are susceptible. Namely probably Gabe and Louis. And other people who are vulnerable to deception of the green brothers and Emily graslie,0,0
Whether we wanted it or not  we&#39;ve stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let&#39;s get to taking out their command  one by one. Valus Ta&#39;aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He&#39;s well protected  but with the right team  we can punch through those defenses  take this beast out  and break their grip on Freehold.,1,1

As a destiny player watching the game die couldn&#39;t be funnier after seeing all the destiny killers fail only for the real &quot;destiny killer&quot; to be none other than bungie themselves.,2,1

Terrible drop rates were the reason Destiny 1 worked. When they made it easier to attain high end gear the game went downhill,0,0

The problem with the Destiny 2 &quot;Starter Pack&quot; wasn&#39;t that it was a bad value (though it was). The issue was the game has been desperately needing an infusion of new blood for months if not years now  new players often struggle with figuring out what to do and where  and Bungie thought &quot;Yes  THOSE are the people we want to rip off for the chance to get a few thousand dollars of revenue.&quot;<br><br>These types of poor management decisions have plagued Bungie for years now  and I really hope it encourages them to take a hard look at the people in those positions  because they have a lot of talented people working on D2 and other games in development.,3,1
