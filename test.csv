Feedback: while a fun video  as a video essay its pretty meh at best. You repeat simple points  go on mini tangents while running past important points that need the actual thorough explanation/deconstruction. Adding to this  the b footage for lethal company is lacking in terms of both quality and quantity  worse considering its your good/ideal example illustrating the whole point of the video. The section with &#39;stupid 2 dollar game&#39; you barely had 2 hours in could have been cut entirely and nothing of value would have been lost.,0,0

Great video with valid points about funnyness and spooks. I feel like more games should have proximity chat with some sort of twist and they should experiment more with post-death mechanics  like the distortion and becoming a mummy in Forelorned.,49,0
A huge boon to Lethal Company is how short the levels can be  the game doesn&#39;t end up feeling tedious and if you lose several people or meet insurmountable odds  you can just mulligan the job and make the quota another day.<br>Players dying and being left out is less of a problem because of the shorter levels.<br>Scaling difficulty and the time limit both help it as well.<br><br>Also the game isn&#39;t goofy despite the horror  it knows it&#39;s funny  but it also knows how to scare you.,0,0

&quot;MIHGs&quot; have always been in this sort of limbo where no matter what they do  the best they can ever be is what I like to call &#39;fun-bad&#39;  where their poor quality is actually what makes them far more entertaining. I think it&#39;s because this genre of games are basically pairing up the bane of horror with horror itself; that being multiplayer. You&#39;d think that pairing up complete opposites like this would be counter-intuitive  because why bother making a horror game if it&#39;s not going to be scary? But in reality  you actually get the best of both worlds. You get something to scream at as well as something to laugh at. You&#39;d also normally think that the poorly made assets would be a detriment as well  but since multiplayer is already dragging these games so far from the horror elements anyways these assets actually become an even bigger aid in enjoying the game  for the sole fact that you can laugh at how bad it is. <br><br>Factor in the contagious laughter and screaming of your friends and you&#39;ll see that despite these things theoretically not mixing together well in the slightest  it&#39;s almost perfect. Personally  I&#39;m not even a content creator or anything but one session of Lethal Company has given me some of the funniest clips I have ever recorded. On one end I&#39;m in shock after hearing my friend&#39;s screams echo throughout the halls as they&#39;re chased by a giant spider. On the other end  I can&#39;t get over how goofy and stupid the animations in this game are  and even if they are pure dogshit from an animator&#39;s perspective I honestly wouldn&#39;t want to replace them regardless of that.,0,0

In my opinion  the vast majority of horror games are just frustrating. Phasmophobia is a prime example of why; what&#39;s the point of a game where you can&#39;t see anything because it&#39;s always dark? Like  the torches in Phasmo only light up about three millimetres in front of your eyeballs  and that&#39;s the so-called &quot;high-power&quot; ones.,0,0

Laughed to fucking tears when playing Lethal Company with my friend a week ago. We&#39;d been very careful and had had a couple accidents on the way  but we were getting more capable. We had lost our flashlights in the previous mission and had one day left on our quota. Armed with a single road sign as a weapon  no lights and no radios  we very carefully moved through the complex.<br><br><br><br><br>Until my friend stepped on a land mine and blew the both of us to hell. The suddenness  the fact that our disadvantages had nothing to do with our failure and the mediocrity of it all made it an absolute blast. Pun intended.,0,0

This probably will be buried  but I wanted to note that the flaws in separation you note in Labyrinth probably <b>enhance</b> the horror experience. Escaping that anticipated horror by the skin of your teeth probably provides a relief that contrasts with the actual horror of being alone.,0,0
i feel like arma has the same kind of idea but in shooters  the main appeal for me is the random BS u encounter and the memories you make by either the stupidest commentary  surviving things u really shouldn&#39;t or something else random  but there are also very tense moments where bullet are flying everywhere u think u got it and boom there are suddenly 2 ifv&#39;s rolling up not even 200 meters away from you  its why that game is so appealing to me  not the quality or the shooting aspect but its that and i do like some milsim and leading to but it wont take away from the fact that a year later a bunch of people still talk about &#39;&#39;that one moment&#39;&#39; even nicknaming people based on one moment for years to come.,0,0

Lethal Company nails the funny and fear factor with its prox chat and also its ability to create what i would call &quot;Horror Movie Moments&quot; where you&#39;ll be talking to someone  they stop responding  then you turn around only to see some vague shape within the darkness carry off their corpse into the unknown. It is both terrifying and hilarious to see your friend get murdered outta nowhere,0,0
Something I love about lethal company is that one person can play the game like duskers  and you just see people get killed on the monitor. I&#39;ve had a moment where some friends of mine were lost in the main structure and I was trying to help them get back  all while some monster was stalking me outside.,0,0

Another tip: yes a monster is scary  but not nearly as much so as the environment itself being hostile. Having a living maze that grabs people and pulls them into walls is much scarier since you know that the monster is the very thing you&#39;re exploring  and it doesn&#39;t have to chase you to catch you.,1,0

I played Lethal Company today with a couple friends. Horror in general isn&#39;t usually my jam  but I did wanna try it via library sharing cause scavenging and building your resources up is a fun concept for me. Ultimately it didn&#39;t click for me  but there was one day that made the brief experience worthwhile. All 3 of us were exploring the abandoned structure  one friend walks into a room and gets shot dead. The second friend warns me so I walk toward a closed door that&#39;s locked. I knew friend #2 had a key so I turn back to get her to come open it and the turret goes off again. It takes a bit of silence for me to realize I am now all alone. I have no idea what this game can throw at me and barely knew how to navigate and play. But I persevere. I end up finding loot to fill my inventory and back track. Nothing threatened me at any point  but just being alone and unsure like that was a very tense and exhilarating experience.<br><br>I think if the scavenging gameplay loop were just a bit more accessible and didn&#39;t call for a coordinator back at base I would have dove right in  but from what I experienced there was just a bit too much push back for me to have fun.,1,1

Another game that I feel like gets slept on with a fun gameplay loop and horror aesthetic is Outlast Trials. It&#39;s got a gratuitous amount of gore  but it&#39;s a solid experience with in-game chat that acts like the radio when far away  and proximity when close by. And some harder missions have modifiers where enemies can hear your chat.,0,0

I half disagree with the title. If you look at something like newest outlast  you see that there&#39;s basically zero horror involved and it really falls flat.<br><br>You really need both. Or rather  the nature of co-op makes humor unavoidable  but what works is making it scary AND funny  like you said.,0,0

It makes me very unhappy that despite how low end friendly Lethal Company is my archaic computer is still too old and nasty to support a decent framerate on it. I don&#39;t doubt it will be fun regardless  but running at less than 20 fps I can&#39;t help but imagine will dampen the experience,0,0

i think this balance between funny and scary is so good in coop horror videogames (as also seen in ttrpgs  for example dimension 20 neverafter)  is because it adds contrast. you need more lighthearted silly moments to make the horror feel more grounded. no one wants to play a game that&#39;s sad and scary 24/7. tension is a way to cause terror  but also breaking up tension with laughs is more reliable in groups. people naturally try to joke when scared  so leaning into that without breaking immersion can work well. i feel like i keep repeating myself but anyway. i just think this is neat. imo all good stories/experiences require some kind of contrast. i could definitely articulate this better  but i&#39;ll save it for my actual essays bc i&#39;m already writing <b>so many</b> as an english major rn lol.,1,1

I think a big thing to notice with the better / more popular co-op horror games is how goofy everything looks <i>from an outside perspective.</i><br><br>Your characters will look silly with unrealistic animations which breaks the tension and leads to good times with your friends.<br>But the trick is that when your friends are gone  all of those issues disappear with them  and youre left with a much more realistic horror experience.<br><br>Except now you really <b>are</b> truly alone and lost. You cant know theres a checkpoint or save file coming up.<br>These games will unapologetically let you die bullshit deaths  scared and alone  actually alone- just moments after one of the silliest moments youve ever shared.<br><br>Eventually  that possibility to lose control at a moments notice will eat away at you even when youre completely safe.<br>Its <b>real</b> fear.

Honestly a fascinating study in the field of scary-funny horror games is Slender Fortress (TF2 Mod)  and its children Midnight Horrors (ROBLOX Game) and Terrors of Nowhere (VRChat World).<br><br>When everything occurs correctly these games can legitimately scary and horrifying  even if these games can also have like  12+ people in a game at once. Whether through the sheer horror and suspense of Slender Fortress&#39; Weeping Angels  to the alarming terror of seeing V2 sliding at you at Mach 2 in Terrors VR  if arranged correctly there&#39;s an equal amount of fear for everyone in this big table.,1,0
I feel like the flowerman/brackern is almost the perfect implementation of the crypt. It perfectly acts as a stalking enemy with it running away if spotted however if you stare too long it decides it can&#39;t go back to stalking and just ganks you. also glowing eyes in the dark are lizard brain spooky.,8,0

Maybe im just missing somehting but every bit of footage ive seen of Lethal Company makes it look boring as fuck. The most generic and least interesting walk around and pick things up game ive seen.

Feel like this basically boils down to two player types: the player who doesn&#39;t like horror games  and thus dicks around looking for something funny rather than actually playing   and the person who wants to play the damn game and is desperately trying to not be angry at the dipshit dicking off.<br><br>Horror games absolutely should not be catering to the first player.,0,0
Lethal Company IS content though,0,0
lethal company nailed it flawlessly  the game is genuinely terrifying but it doesn&#39;t come at the cost of the goofs. one minute you could be screaming for your life as you run (fruitlessly) from a bracken  the next minute you&#39;re ragdolling from a landmine you tripped on. I already have 20 hours on the game  but it&#39;s still funny each time we miss jumps (because we weigh 1 tonne) and fall to our deaths.,0,0

Recently my friends and I played Lethal Company and while it was late and waiting on a teammate to make it back to the ship we’re just talking and laughing  then a blind dog jumped through the door at top speed killed one friend while myself and my BF just STOPPED talking and moving  it left and I closed the door and we just started laughing more.<br><br>The game keeps you so tense even if you’re in the safety of the ship  I was on terminal duty trying to guide everyone  and I heard the stomping and a dog outside.

There is mainly good horror games  that can make the gameplay scare you  but multi-player horror struggles to make losing others scary at all. Multiplayer horror(even Lethal Company which I find an insanely good and unique horror game) will often make losing players  like it just happens  and it&#39;s an inconvenience when it happens. There is NO impact to losing your friends in any horror I&#39;ve seen  and I would like if someone could recommend a game like that. But death is almost never one-shot permadeath and I find it unfortunate and destroys immersion.,0,0
I think another good example of Funny more than Scary is the Friday the 13th game. The hilarious facial animations  proxy chat between Campers and Jason and   the ability to emote! What takes the most away from the fear is that Campers have the ability to fight back and its possible (but very unlikely) to kill Jason! Sure you&#39;ll probably all die in the process trying to escape but it is always funny to knock Jason down and dance on him.,1,0
Comedy and horror are like a holy dichotomy for making any kind of media.<br><br>If you&#39;re making an actual horror game  for instance  pure horror all the time can become overwhelming  intense  a constant build of pressure.<br><br>Sometimes  this is the atmosphere you want  but if you do it too much  it might get draining for the player  and they might not continue playing.<br><br>Comedy is the easiest way to introduce a moment of brevity  and it&#39;s presence can lessen the strain  which bolsters the impact of the actual scary moments.<br><br>Additionally  it is exceptional as being false brevity  if executed well  Comedic moments can be ripped away for sudden moments of terror  making it absolutely terrifying as you&#39;re ripped away from the safety of the comedy sections<br><br>Similarly  if you&#39;re making something comedy  introducing horror elements (ACTUAL horror  not just a jump scare) can create a FANTASTIC expectation with a high impact  making the subversion of that (the punchline)  even more funny<br><br>Lethal Company excels at this balance. It constantly feels safe  thanks to the comfort of having friends and the overall silly tone  enhancing the (genuinely quite good in their own right) horror elements thanks to that sudden lack of safety.<br><br>And these sudden moments of horror make the silly elements even funnier  especially the monsters themselves. It&#39;s something you laugh about once in the safety of your (possibly dead) friends once it&#39;s all over,1,0

Another thing I love about Lethal Company is that the monsters all have weird quirks about them that can be exploited. In most MIHGs  the monster is just some big guy who paths towards you and you beat him by running in the other direction. But things like dog monsters that are blind and only respond to sounds like footsteps  music  and YOUR VOICE shake that up so much. Walking back to the ship past these things with 2 other friends when you&#39;re all full up with loot is simultaneously hilarious and terrifying. Or monsters that are the opposite  deaf but with good vision. All of it culminates into these moment by moment interactions that become even more chaotic when 2 or more monster types interact together,14,1

Comedy is certainly one way to lower your guard. It gives a sense of safety knowing that  yes you&#39;re laughing.

One of the best and scariest parts of &quot;Escape from the backrooms&quot; is definitely the monsters pretending to be one of your friends. Like I&#39;ve only watched videos of it  but that shit got me tense even as a viewer. It also helps prevent that herd-mentality of going to stay in a group with your friends  but I can only imagine how effective it would be if two features were included. The first is the group-splitting from Labyrinthine  so your group could suddenly lose a member  and now the group would be scared of allowing the lost member to come close in case it was an imposter  and the lost player would be scared to approach other flashlights. This was especially apparent in the video I watched where the player knew that all his friends were dead  but still a flashlight was coming towards him and trying to regroup. The second way would be to fuck with the proximity-chat by having monsters able to silence players  so they couldn&#39;t communicate  and maybe have the game save proximity-chats for short periods during sessions  and then play them back coming from a monster  and by combining these so a player would be silenced and their voice was instead played directly from a monster&#39;s location. All these together would be terrifying if done well  and potentially hilarious if a bit scuffed.,30,1
Co-op horrors must be funny  because that is what makes them actually scary. Like you feel that loneliness and atmosphere when you lets say lost.

Phasmophobia is the perfect game to play with 3 friends  with the condition that all 4 of you know NOTHING about the game. The fun part is the first couple of days playing where everything is very spooky  and you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. The moment you are familiar with the game and the mechanics and how to catch a ghost is the moment it stops being scary  and thus stops being fun. Some of the best gaming moments I&#39;ve had with friends come from phasmo when we all knew nothing and all were scared shitless to go inside the house  but now we can&#39;t really play it anymore since the scariness is gone.<br><br>One thing that also helped phasmo is how janky the animations are  made some hilarious moments,0,0

This game KILLED my fear response  the mortal fear you get from having days of progress be threatened is nothing like any horror game. Not once has a single horror game ever scared me since I started playing it. A jumpscare doesn’t have stakes  and the paranoia is trumped by knowing any second a single mistake means you lose everything. 10/10 game.,1,0

I&#39;ve always wanted to play one of these with my small group  and we finally got together for Lethal Company. We couldn&#39;t believe it when we stopped for the night and it was 6 hours later  it was hilarious  terrifying and filled with plenty of stupid decisions.<br><br>We ended up always having one person in the ship giving directions  and it&#39;s so good when they slowly realize everyone is dead. Or the radio person inside hears them panic and then go silent. It does prox chat so well.,23,0

It&#39;s also worth noting that some people don&#39;t get scared by anything or use humor to cope with things that scare them. If there is no funny aspect to the game and all it has is horror  its impact will be severely damaged by anyone that fits into either of those categories. Imagine someone going around  laughing their ass off at literally everything they&#39;re confronted with  and their mood infecting everyone they&#39;re playing with. If all you&#39;ve got is that scariness and it gets stripped away by the wrong kind of person  your game isn&#39;t going to be all that fun to play anymore.<br><br>Laughter absolutely murders fear.

I totally agree with your review of Phas  it&#39;s not really fun  and it&#39;s really not that scary. Granted I haven&#39;t played it solo so I suppose I&#39;ll try that. I find it generally pretty boring  the only part making it enjoyable is multiplayer.,1,0
Phasmophobia is honestly at its peak when everyone is separated or maybe in teams lf two snd everyonr is tryng to communicate on the radio  and then you see the lights go off and a cutoff scream on the radio. thats peak group funniness and horror,1,0

One day there will be a co-op horror game that isn&#39;t made to be a gag reel generator. One day. And no disrespect to the devs of Lethal Company or most of the other games  but somehow co-op horror is one of the most poorly defined genres of game since they usually aren&#39;t horrific at all. It usually just means proxy chat while things kill you in the dark.,1,4

GREAT GREAT ASSET TO THE COMPANY,0,0
you really like the dirty harry theme,0,0
lethal company is great for three main reasons  the first and obvious one is the voice chat and all its modifiers   the joy and horror of bumbling around and discovering things like monster info  and the fact that everything serves as a double dip for usefulness and funny  the stun gun is useful but funny  the jetpack is great for speedruning about is just as likely to blow you up  ladders and rockets can accidentally kill you  its the perfect mixture of utility while still being useful,55,0

A lot of credit of Crypt&#39;s spooky factor should be given to Crypt&#39;s aesthetic. In a first person lost-in-the-woods game you&#39;re already comfortable just because they&#39;re so ubiquitous. In Crypt  you don&#39;t know what to expect from the very start because the gameboy-like shaders are very alien to most players  making them ask &quot;If this is different  what else could be?&quot; and allowing them to build their own fear much more efficiently.,667,2

I think one of the bigger things that Lethal Company brings is that your teammates can die (often in dumb situations)  which gives you a more spectator view. Similar to laughing at someone getting jumpscared in a video. It&#39;s a different perspective  and well worth using.,396,3
Roblox has quite a few funny ass horror games to play with friends on there one of my favorites being escape edp if you are playing solo they usually just end up being ass,1,0

Why do I think that Vale is going to take some inspiration from this new game to make a new &quot;funny&quot; activity?,29,0
Regularly playing co-op horror games is like sifting through a pile of horse manure because one of your horses ate a diamond.,10,0
I think Phasmo is more comparable to DbD than the rest of these horror games. It catches the masses by being &#39;horror&#39; but keeps players with competition. This means if you play a lot the scary factor goes down  but you are more focussed on getting better. <br>Ask any player of those games with 200+ hours if they think the game is still scary. They play because they want to be good at the game. <br><br>That&#39;s just my two cents  thanks for the video!,57,0

It reminds me of SCP:SL but more focus on you having to be alive. Funny as hell,3,0
Phasmophobia is the modern poster child for Multiplayer Scary Game but the fact that you can basically &quot;solve&quot; it kinda ruins it (go in with thermometer  find cold room  put all equipment in there and wait until you find the ghost) couple that with the fact that the ghosts don&#39;t really interact with the player in any meaningful way and they all pretty much do the same kill animation of &quot;Stand there in the flicker light until you go spectator&quot; and yeah it gets pretty stale pretty fast.<br><br>Lethal Company is almost like the antithesis of it  all the monsters do their own thing and have their own behavior so dealing with one is entirely different than dealing with any other one and there&#39;s also the fact that you can&#39;t &quot;solve&quot; it due to the random generation aspect of its factories and houses. Plus if you get bored of the gameplay loop it&#39;s always funny to hear someones audio get cut off by a landmine,644,2
One thing that I think multiplayer games can do to be truly scary in ways single player really can’t as effectively is organically making you feel helpless.<br><br>Like yes  in a single-player game  you have the feeling of being alone. And that works for awhile  but you DO acclimate to it.<br><br>But compare that to a multiplayer game. Lethal Company  for example: you’re going through the bunker  chatting with your friends  cracking jokes  gathering scrap. Not scary in the slightest. But then  for just a moment  there’s a scream that gets quickly cut off  you turn and see a Bracken holding your friend’s corpse for just a second as it darts around a corner and disappears  and suddenly you’re alone. It’s dark. Blood trails on the floor where just moments before you and your pal were happily cracking wise. And the jovial banter is replaced with crushing silence.<br><br>That feeling  of being suddenly RENDERED alone after getting used to just vibing with your friends and knowing there’s nothing you can do about it  is a truly unique kind of horror that single-player games just can’t effectively replicate.,1394,8
