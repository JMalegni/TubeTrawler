"Just goes to show that you can have all the gun laws and restrictions that you want...First they&#39;ll still find a way in. But really, secondly, it illustrates that they really aren&#39;t the issue. More of a symptom of a degradation or break down in society. Crime tends to pop up first in areas of high wealth disparity and spreads because of failing cultural norms. That&#39;s probably why Germany is lagging behind for now - I bet that they&#39;re more rigid. That is why (at least in my part of the world) that small town life experiences less violent crime - a better sense of community. <br><br>I&#39;m skeptical that &quot;getting tougher on crime&quot; is going to solve the problem. Perhaps reduce, BUT it&#39;s a double edged sword - power will always seek to expand itself and once more cops are recruited, more technology is implemented, more tools are purchased for the purposes of combating crime, there will be an increased need to utilize them - to justify their existence. But that leads to an eventual police state, because it&#39;s an evolution. These sorts of things NEVER shrink when a problem is solved, only evolve bigger. Want example? Look at the US and their cops. Militarized groups of at times very violent and trigger happy men and women rolling around like they&#39;re an occupying force.",0,0

"the nordic criminal hugging has gone way overboard - went the justice departments focus turns into rehabilitating the criminals, but forgetting the victims, things are going really bad. While i do agree such social programs are in general necessary, punishments need to be genuine punishments and not some pats on the head and then cut it in half for whatever reason later on. This kind of overly soft way of handling punishments is sending wrong signal to both the criminals and honest normies alike.<br><br>An excellent start for reforming punishments would be the return of public shaming for minor crimes. Its ridiculous that already starting from elementary school when kids misbehave and even hurt each other, these days the teachers cannot publicly handle the matter - instead the misbehaviour and its punishments are hidden away from rest of the class/school of &quot;privacy&quot; reasons.   Alot of youth criminals would never had gotten that far, if they had had to suffer for the far more minor misdeeds since young - but unfortunately the system is such that that everything is &quot;private&quot; - even if it affects others and even their health.",0,0

A small handful of cities have a very specific demographic problem who use guns violently. It&#39;s not the same thing. The US has a <b>cough</b> inner city &#39;culture&#39; problem.

American leftists always hail Sweden as the greatest place on earth as they do many many other countries. Yet they never leave. They also always compare the US to other countries when it comes to violence. The US has more people living with more freedom and more money than other countries. Those all equal the freedom to do good or bad on a greater scale.<br>They also fail to understand that it is left minded people committing over 90% of the crime. That’s a fact. Just because the conservatives think guns are a right to own does NOT a make them responsible for the crimes committed by the left that commit them.,1,1

"As the globe warms and arid regions become increasingly inhospitable, people from the Middle East and North Africa may be compelled to migrate northward. Concurrently, European populations are experiencing a significant decline, potentially obliging governments to welcome these new workers and consumers. However, European countries often face challenges in effectively integrating immigrants. This dynamic, combined with a decreasing native European population and an increasing number of immigrants, could lead to significant social unrest. Furthermore, should the economy of the European Union falter or disintegrate, the consequences could be catastrophic. Such changes would irreversibly alter Europe&#39;s social and cultural landscape. The wealthiest and most resourceful individuals might seek refuge in other regions, such as the Americas. And those remaining may lash out violently.",0,0

"As a South African living in Sweden, a part of the problem I see is a general sense of apathy, which parallels the lack of planning. There&#39;s the expectation that immigrants must integrate in all ways of their own accord with little help or guidance. And then, using that sense of apathy, if you don&#39;t managed to integrate well this is simply your own fault.<br><br>The second aspect directly relating to gangs is where gangs inevitably get their money from, namely drugs. Sweden, *societally*, has a zero tolerance for drugs. Drugs are treated 100% as a criminal issue by everyone, not just the justice system. One of the positive results of this zero tolerance is that the historical statistics show fewer people, per capita, have sought drugs in their youth. The negatives however are quite bad! Addicts in Sweden have a very high chance of dying from an overdose compared to the average European. Addicts dare not seek help or give even a hint to a doctor that they are an addict, else they risk losing everything! Again, that apathy coming in strong. ",0,0

"As a Western Canadian and the son of immigrants, I think that Sweden&#39;s police and government would benefit a lot from talking with Criminologists and Police Departments out here. It&#39;s just a fact that large waves of immigration are often followed by crime waves, it&#39;s happened several times here in my living memory. However, if you&#39;ve been around this long enough, it&#39;s clear that crime waves are just that, waves that come forth, make a big splash and then retreats back and subsides. Basically, you need to find a balance of aggressively going after these gangs without completely alienating the law abiding people from those communities, and within a period of time that generation of gang members will either be in jail or have murdered each other off. That&#39;s the point where, as a government and society, you have an opportunity to address a lot of the underlying issues like racism, economic disparity and alienation to try and prevent another wave. <br><br>Sometimes that other wave is inevitable, we had a huge crime wave of Indo-Canadian and Vietnamese gangs here in the 90s, a lot of these gang members were refugees hardened by the camps, a lot of them were impressionable and weak minded kids that felt alienated from Canadian society and flocked to anyone in their community offering them some direction or sense of belonging. Once that wave ended using the above method, things really did improve, but then 15 years later another generation of east Indian and WHITE upper middle class gangs popped up formed by a bunch of stupid, spoiled kids that had overall very cushy lives, but were influenced by American rap music and gangster movies, and thought they looked cool dealing drugs out of their daddy&#39;s BMWs. Now all of those guys are dead or in jail and things are again relatively peaceful and generally trending up (at least in terms of gun violence, lots of other problems here)<br><br>You basically have 2 options, you can just kick all of them out, or you can learn how to manage these waves and understand that immigration is a multi-generational process on both sides of the equation. The big immigration dividend you get, as a country, generally comes a generation or two later when you get people like me that were born in the country, are generally well integrated, well educated and make more money than the average, start businesses and actually see themselves as Canadian (or Swedish), but a LOT of things have to go right to break that violent cycle for that to happen. I do realize that there are factors in Europe and other &quot;Old World&quot; countries that can make this integration more difficult than here, basically the whole point of this overly long comment is to recognize there are extreme difficulties with this situation in Sweden, but there are proven ways to improve the situation in the long term and real benefits of weathering the storm and approaching solutions with a level of nuance. At the end of the day, I believe in democracy and that if the majority of Swedes don&#39;t want immigrants, don&#39;t want to deal with these issues and non-swedes in their country, then that&#39;s how it should be. I&#39;m just glad that my family was able to make a better life here in Canada for us and that I am now in the position where I feel like I belong here and can give back",0,0

"Americans have been studying gang violence for a long time (because it is so bad here) and the research has unearthed a few truths. Increasing punishment does little to nothing, so longer prison sentences do not deter crime. However, increasing the perception that you will be caught while doing something illegal has a profound effect. This is why the &quot;stop shooting&quot; type programs in the US were successful.<br><br>The key to lowering the violent crime rate is actually increasing the case clearance rate by law enforcement, and it isn&#39;t actually because you&#39;re removing criminals from the streets. With things like lucrative monetary incentives there&#39;s always someone to replace the person that you&#39;ve locked up. It is the perception that you will get caught, and that you will go to jail, and the crime isn&#39;t worth it that will disincentivize people from taking to a life of crime and break the cycle.<br><br>Some of the actual research on this: (This is a very quick read, but the supporting evidence is cited) <a href=""https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/247350.pdf"">https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/247350.pdf</a>",1,0

I am thinking of something like the Guardian Angels, but not uniformed, better trained, and armed to some degree. Neighborhood Watch, but hardcore and with Peace Officer powers. There are quite a few documented instances of someone successfully defending themselves against assault, only to bear the full brunt of the legal system brought against them, the victim of aggression.

Canada is headed in the same direction with massive immigration and allowing asylum seekers into the country with a housing shortage. Asylum seekers are living in homeless shelters or on the streets since there is already a homeless problem. The long mostly undefended border with the United States allows plenty of illegal guns into the country while the government focuses on taking guns away from lawful law abiding gun owners. The massive migration over the US southern border isn’t going to help either since some of those that cross illegally into the United States will find their way into Canada where it is safer for them to operate. Far few guns in the hands of citizens and far stricter laws about self defence makes it less likely that they will get shot by a homeowner while robbing their house. Lenient laws around bail and shorter prison terms provide a good environment for criminals. In Vancouver the same 40 were arrested 6000 times in one year. Violent crime is on the rise and will only get worse as more people come into the country and have no housing and social services are overwhelmed. The government is also being more lenient on immigrant criminals saying they are over represented in or prison population and that is racist. Gang violence is also on the rise. A few weeks ago a man was killed by a rival gang while sitting in his car and his 11 year old son was shot and killed with him.

When your national history is characterized by peace and domestic tranquility any uptick in crime and violence is readily apparent. Sweden&#39;s situation is being interpreted in the context of other European nations. Everyone seems to forget that compared to the rest of the planet the EU is extraordinarily crime-free.

I would say boiling the right’s crime and immigration argument down to “immigrants are inherently criminal” is such a woeful mischaracterization of the point that simply saying “some on the right” falls far too short to excuse it. It did not need to be phrased this way. It could have simply been “Some on the right to say high levels of immigration will increase crime”.

"Statistics aside it is still a very safe place. That a handful of bigger cities struggle is more than obvious. Most of the country have little to no connection to the issues that are at hand. <br><br>Some of the thoughts and things you bring to the table are fairly accurate. Some seem well like an outsider looking in. So allow me to add a few important things to the understanding of whats going on. Most people here today will just point at the massive influx of refugees that arrived in 2015 and right after. Like mentioned in the vid this is for many controversial for the simple reason that it is very hard for far to many to keep 2 thoughts in their head at the same time. It did provide gangs with cannon fodder it did open up a crack that has been here for a very, very long time. it did strain a system that was already poorly desgined to breaking point. But this is not where it began. <br>The beginning of the issues we are dealing with right now begins with the war in Yugoslavia, the fall of the berlin wall and the soviet union. Up to the early 1990s Sweden had been a focused nation . Militarized to the point of ridcule a society ordered in near martial form from the very first day in school until you got old enough to not be worried about being called in should ww3 erupt. Five generations of people glued together by this drive. <br>After the fall of the east and the influx of people form the former yugoslavia the first problems arose. They introduced a new type of gang a new type of crime more visible more offensive than what had been previously seen nor known. Older officers here at work can attest to the gangs of old where an elderly nice chap would almost be buddies with the cops that arrested them. There were biker gangs and nationalists doing their thing ofcourse but the fall of yugoslvia brought a type of gang that by default were anti-order. There is a difference here that is bigger than most care to admit. <br><br>Now the issues begin. For not only did a new type or a diffrent type of crime get imported. After spending 50 years sinking so much into the army and keeping Sweden in a state of perpetual rediness combined with the economic crash of the early 90s funding was removed. The police suffered, not as horrendously as the army, but spending was cut. The old community police was removed and rolled in to be a more centralized police force. Police precincts were closed down enmass across the entire nation. Regions were made larger with few and few cities having manned police stations. This along with lenient laws, as described, allowed a foothold for the type of criminality that has now exploded to fester, to grow. <br>Back in the 80s and 90s drugs had started to weed themselves into society at a far higher rate than ever before. Already back in those days people were starting to grumble about how silly the laws are here. I mean even to this day a person that download to many bootlegged movies, especially if they distribute them, will be punished more severly than youths comitting murder or anyone comitting a sexuall assault. &quot;Fixing&quot; this has been on the publics mind for atleast 30 years. As long as i can remember. What we got instead was 20 years of inaction from our governments that instead of trying to be proactive cut spending more and more and enjoyed that image of Sweden being this utopia for all. One of the goverments abouts 20 years ago removed the old integration policies entirely. There used to be a requirement here to go to school to be helped to integrate into society but thats gone. Its open doors and have at it at this point. <br><br>The reaction that is happening right now has been several years in the making. Im not talking about the crime but for almost 10 years now the wheels have finaly begun to turn into something that isnt an ideallized version of naive. One of the problems we have here that keeps adding to the fire is our media. It is woefully innocent in its believes and its pushing that naive idealized agenda and keeps making the discourse thats needed about the topic &quot;immigration - crime&quot; harder. Everyone is fearful of Swedens most powerful institution and no one wants to end up being called out as a bad person, racist or whatever by our media. They have immense power here. Unlike in any other nation they have no oversight they are politically driven and a substantial part of the population believes every words as the exact truth. This is also a leftover from the cold war. Swedish media had to be very clear in those days and everyone born up and until the late 90s have been brought up on that the media freedom we enjoy and the like makes them the good guys. But they are driven hard by their own agendas and like already mentioned have made the issues far, far worse. Having spent my entire life working for the governemnt its always been very apparent that their angles and their information is at best 50/50. They have begun a process of understanding in the last few years. However the damage they have wrought over the last few decades might be the hardest thing to fix. <br><br>There is alot of things that needs to be done. Proper integration into our society and country again like it used to be. Realizing that quantity just to look nice on the world stage is probably dumb. Back in 2015 every single free apartment, hostel, hotell, B and B were full to bursting. It was physically impossible to get more people into the country without having them in tents. Alot of the influx from those years have since returned or left for other countires because coming here was a horrible ordeal. We need more officers, alot more. The archaic superfriendly justice system that was made in a time and for people that were a whole lot diffrent than we have today is sorely needed as well. Its in the works but even if every decision that is petitioned or being looked at is passed today its still gonna take several years before the effects are known. This is an issue much like the mafia problems, the triads, the yakuza or the prohibition era in the US. It will take this entire decade to sort out im sure. <br><br>Big block of text.

"Fifteen is an unrealistically high age of criminal responsibility. Fourteen year-olds know what they are doing when they commit a crime. My country has it at ten, like Britain, which is more realistic, though I could see an argument for 12. I personally think it should be different based on the type of crime. Minor crimes should get some leeway, as there is often no victim, or more likely the victim is abstract to a young mind, so there isn&#39;t a full comprehension of the harm done. When the crime has a clear and obvious victim, as in violent crimes, then it&#39;s different, because in that situation even a young offender knows that what they are doing will harm someone. If they want to mitigate the stigma for younger offenders then there are better ways to do it than just not punishing them, such as expunging public records if they stay out of trouble for a set time period after finishing their sentence.<br><br>As for absorbing large numbers of refugees, that is something that has to be done carefully. If societies want immigrants to assimilate quickly, they have to meet them halfway and help them do that, which is not what Sweden did. Certain supports need to be given to them, such as free lessons in the local language, laws and culture, as well as support navigating the new environment, such as having someone who can help them with finding the things they need, as well as dealing with public services and bureaucracy. Housing needs to be planned so that people are spread out, not concentrated in one or two locations. It&#39;s natural for people in a strange land to seek out people they can relate to, such as people who come from the same country or speak the same language (Western expats do this too). However, when a culturally distinct group all moves into the same area, to the point where they are now close to being, or are a majority there, then it becomes a very big obstacle to assimilation. Assimilating to a completely foreign environment is hard, so if people are surrounded by their own people then the temptation is to just re-create their original society on a smaller, local scale. When there&#39;s just a few people from a group in an area, they are forced to adapt to that area&#39;s culture while still having a few familiar faces they can lean on. In most cases they are happy to do this, and being immersed in their new culture works well if supported. But if you don&#39;t get that immersion, if most of the people around you are from your place of origin, then the path of least resistance is to not bother. Of course, all this is what Sweden should&#39;ve done from the start, but that ship has sailed now.",0,0

"An important part to address is the ideological conformity in Sweden which fostered a pronounced what aboutism defence of the immigration policy for decades. Any critique of the direction society was headed in was attacked by the media and politicians. Officials who spoke out were forced to step down and were publicly ridiculed by the media and politicians alike for being alarmist and right wing. Thereby reinforcing to the populace, don’t think like them, that’s not correct and your life will be affected. This killed any meaningful debate on the matter, when foreign press dared to question the rise in crime in Swedens ghettos, the Swedish media said they were trying to tarnish “the Swedish image”. A construct created through decades of marketing Sweden as “a humanitarian super power”. Something Swedes who lack any form of personality desperately cling to and defend. It’s important to understand what an effect legacy media has had on the way Swedes think for almost a century. People have trusted the media and politicians to a fault. “Open your hearts”, what we need is to open an investigation into the systematic suppression of the truth and the skewing of crime statistics in order to deny the people from making informed choices in elections.

"I live less than 20 kilometres from the bridge between Denmark and Sweden, and I have developed an idea about a root cause problem with Swedish culture, which might explain some of Swedens seemingly inexplicable oddity, compared to their neighbours. You see, Sweden are not just going off the road when they are doing it in a left direction. Before Sweden ran leftist policies ad absurdum, Sweden ran rightist policies ad absurdum. From the 1900&#39;s to Palme (1960s), Sweden was at the forefront of eugenics. Both based on social and racial factors. While Denmark was also aligning with Germany before WWII, we imported our legislation and &#39;research&#39; from Sweden. I&#39;ve even seen an whole page add for social eugenics printed in an issue of &#39;Familie Journalen&#39; (Family Journal) from 1928, written and paid for by a prominent Swedish doctor. My guess is that Sweden will run any political idea off its rails, and I suspect that it is because of their high emphasis on conformity, as observed by any Dane in Sweden, and reported/lamented by most Swedish emigrants to Copenhagen (many great bartenders in Copenhagen are candid Swedes. Candid Swedes have refugee status in Denmark).<br><br>My idea is that Sweden, unlike most democracies in Europe, has not had the fortune of being invaded post democracy. Denmark made some poor choices in 1864 and got invaded by early Germany Early in our Democratic period. Later, Germany made some poor choices and got (counter)invaded by everybody. France, Norway, Finland, Czechia, Poland etc. Everybody seems to have an understanding imbedded in their democratic cultures, that if we agree too much with each other, the outcome might be still be terrible, and it might even be because we agreed so much with ourselves. Sweden, on the contrary, has not been invaded, since the Russian Empire did so in 1812. Pre-democratic Sweden. As a result they have a functioning democracy, but with a cultural pressure against deviating opinions, in public debates. An autocratic culture in a democratic state.",1,1

"You failed to address the political aspects that have allowed this development. The conservatives desire to weaken unions through low paid immigrants that wouldn&#39;t join unions and the socialists ideological alliance with the &quot;oppressed global south&quot; that has made them reliant on voter groups from that part of the world. Ruling coalitions have been steered by these two main parties which have both implemented policies to let in more refugees, with slogans such as: &quot;Open your hearts&quot; (conservative), &quot;My Europe does not build walls&quot; (Socialist). As violence started to escalate and parallel societies developed it became important to explain away these phenomena, by saying &quot;Swedes have always been violent&quot;, &quot;Sweden has always had gangs&quot;. When the Council for Crime Prevention started presenting statistics that most criminals were either foreign born or their parents were, the gov stopped them from presenting nationalities. Most concerning was that many leading politicians explained away the fact that so many foreigners were criminals (predominantly from certain regions) by blaming Swedes. They said it was the Swedish societies fault for not reaching out to them, they called Swedes inherently racist and said that socio economic factors were behind the rise in crime. This is key to the Socialist philosophy, humans are oppressed by capitalism and the state needs to give them money to allow people to be able to rise up from this oppression and succeed. But remember the reports from the Council of Crime Prevention that had been limited in scope...they had analysed data from all over the world including Sweden and concluded that socio economic factors do not determine if an individual will commit crime, but rather cultural factors. IE we are shaped by our environment (culture). The council decided to present the data with ethnicity now, but made it clear in their report that the restrictive parameters the government had set them limited both the value and scope of the report and reiterated the importance in identifying where problems are in order to mitigate them. This was still a negative look for the ideologically driven immigration policy so they were no longer allowed to present any, more, reports, at, all.

Their excuse being oh the bell reminded us of the air raid sirens...the war had started and ended in 91 they would never have heard them. Do you know what the teachers and parents said? &quot;Its not their fault, they come from hard backgrounds, countries ravaged by war, its our societies duty to help them.&quot; This may sound familiar, as it is the mantra both politicians and the media have parroted for 30 years. We are in this situation because people from cultures where violence is used to dominate others have had their actions excused for far too long. They have seen that they can hurt Swedes and the public, the media and the politicians will come to their defence. These people come from countries where cities are divided into clan structures, where the law in one city may differ from another because of these clans. So naturally they will turn to these structures here, thereby operating outside of the Swedish legal system. Swedish naivety, thinking that everyone wants Swedish values and that throwing welfare at them will make them Swedish is a farce. Welfare is defrauded to the tune of 10 billion euros (of which is known). What is needed is US style prisons, integrating them into society can happen through work placements within these prisons. Recidivism for gang members is over 90%, all these posts about fancy prison cells in Sweden...they may have worked when there was a different population. These people come from countries where cops beat them to death in jail, or if you&#39;re bad enough the secret police will make you disappear. Obviously that is wrong, but to think that they will respect our system after coming from that is naive. They&#39;ve quickly figured out that using 13 year olds as hitman will result in no jail terms...child soldiers...where are those found? Sweden is a representative democracy, its free education was created in order to have more effective democratic participants. Now ask yourselves, if the media and politicians purposely skew data, deny the growth of crime and its connection with unfettered immigration by limiting the scope of the crime prevention councils research, they dismiss police and mp&#39;s who speak out on this and attack what they say as right wing with neo n*zi undertones...Is this still a functioning democracy?

Simply opening your doors to strangers, does not whatsoever guarantee that they will be grateful to you or contribute to your ecosystem.

At the fringes of society, I can understand how such problems with adjusting can produce extremely maladjusted and dysfunctional people prone to gang violence and terrorism. This is a colossal topic I could probably write my own book about. I believe in some respects this is intertwined with other cultural tumours such as hookup culture, divorce rates, etc, fundamentally as a consequence of poor community cohesion.<br><br>UK’s native population also has serious issues.

You can come live and work in the country from all around the world but you will never get citizenship or benefits if your not a native (lived here the last 1000 year&#39;s).

"The reason why the &#39;right&#39; is right in regards to this is as follows: it doesn&#39;t matter how nuanced the problem is, the truth is that if there were no immigrants, Sweden would still be a beautiful, safe and prosperous nation. The Swedish owe NOTHING to these refugees. By international law, the refugees should have stopped at the FIRST safe country. There should NOT be refugee Arabs, Turks, Syrians, Somalis or Yugoslavians in Sweden (except for exceptionally rare instances of individuals needing political asylum, as in they would be executed for their views like a pro-Shah Iranian after the Islamic Revolution of Iran, and even then they are not owed it by the nation). Even if it is a relatively small minority of immigrants who cause the problems; that is still something that the Swedes do not deserve. The Swedes do not have to put up with a few VERY bad apples for the sake of the &#39;good immigrants&#39;. The Swedish government is supposed to look out for the interests of the Swedish people, they are not beholden to immigrants or foreigners whatsoever; yet judging by what has happened, you would think their purpose was to serve the interest of everyone except for the ethnic Swedes.<br><br>The same is true in the UK and other nations. It is true that many immigrants have integrated just fine, but if there were no Irish, there would have been no IRA attacks. If there were no muslims, there would be millions of children in the UK who have been sexually molested and traumatised who would not have been. It is simply NOT FAIR on the native people.

"Great video, thanks! As you say here, the problem and its potential solutions are quite complicated and nuanced. That said, Sweden has historically had a sort of national phobia against fighting crime effectively. As you imply near the end of this video, just the very fact alone that Sweden&#39;s laws are perceived as ridiculously lenient, particularly against juvenile criminals, has skewed the percentage of criminal immigrants upward, as they see the country as a &#39;sitting duck&#39; waiting to be pillaged, and with impunity. That result helps to set it apart from other EU countries that welcome immigrants, such as Germany. As you point out, in other Scandinavian countries, as well as countries like Germany, that shit wouldn&#39;t fly. I also think that ideas like &#39;youth prisons&#39; are a bit laughable. If Swedes really want to deter youth from turning to crime, they should try them as adults and lock them up with adults. The effect on them would be very harsh, but that example would serve to have a more chilling effect on those who might follow in their footsteps. If you talk to Swedes in cities and around the country — and regardless of ethnic background — you will notice very strong opposition to the leniency of their legal system and immigration policies. And many of those same Swedes will tell you the system itself makes it difficult to speak out against these policies. Another point against socialism. ;-)",2,0

I rode my bike maybe an hour earlier very close to the gas station where it happened. Two girls were burned alive in an apartment a subway station away from my building. I&#39;ve seen burning cars 2-3 times and a few burning buildings too. I remember that one time the cops found two cars filled with automatic weapons outside a mall nearby.

"if 85% of gang members have a immigration background, it&#39;s hardly &quot;controversial&quot;, rather effective. Though, of course the incidence rate is to be calculated the other way around. But then again, minorities are by definition fewer in count, so chances of finding someone within a group of migrants is higher. On the other hand it may further force the narrative that these migrants are &quot;not a part of society&quot;, conveniently blaming all responsibility on the &quot;bad system&quot;, while going on with business.<br>Being a migrant myself i feel the duty of being a representative of my roots, whether I feel connected to them or not. And knowing some i rather distance myself from them.<br>I think one cannot overstress the point that some people feel like they are superior to exploit loopholes in the system instead of cooperating with it - and they did because the system was corrupt and dysfunctional. So Sweden should place incentives targeting both ways: 1. teach values of cooperation and peace to young children by bonding them and offering language courses etc and 2. deter by making the risk and consequences much graver.<br>Some other dimension may be that Sweden believes everyone to be responsible for themselves so the government does not interfere as much, as seen in the interventions during Corona. This might be just the wrong approach to integrate new people who do not inherit the old Nordic communal sense and commonwealth but are actually individualistic and tribal and value human lives, at least those of others, very poorly.",1,0

It´s however very sad to see that these videos are beeing made about my homecountry. It´s easy to get really pissed of. I lived in Husby for 6 years and the place is just horrible. Sirens lightned up my living room every day. So a couple monts ago I moved to the only area in town where no shootings have ever been made. It makes me so angry that I have to flee within my own counrty because thease criminals destroys it. Another point is that the situation also breed so much hate towards imigrants due to the fact that they are overrepresnted in criminality which feeds the far right.,3,2

"I don&#39;t quite get it how some people want to assure and hint poignantly that the religion of islam and muslims are somehow inherently incompatible with christian religions. This is absolute bollocks, as christians couldn&#39;t stop killing each other not too long ago. People find whatever excuse they can to point at easy differentiators to BOTH oppress and persecute or retialiate and resist. Faith is just one easy one, as it is malliable over time and space and has such long roots, that there are with certainty wrongdoings and horrible acts to be found.<br><br>The problem is more mundane and hits closer to basic survival and well-being than just faith. In Finland there has been living for centuries a small muslim minority, that by all means and measures is completely Finnish. Their faith has not been a problem. Yes, they have been persecuted in the past and probably will be in the future but they are not making headlines because of their faith. Even though they might have higher criminality among them than in general (I honestly do not know, but that&#39;s beside the point), it&#39;s not because of their faith. It&#39;s because they weren&#39;t given the same resources as the general public due to the general public&#39;s view that they were for some idiotic reason &quot;less deserving&quot; than the average. They were denied growth, they were wealth accumulation. This doesn&#39;t go away fast in one generation, it lingers for a long time. We built a modern equivalent of a persecutory system against immigrants from Eastern European, Middle Eastern, Latin American and African regions. We have not built a systematic way for them to acquire a locally meaningful education and work experience and for them to get that critically important first job. If they are robbed and denied from even trying to get better at something, like labour laws being so inflexible that you can&#39;t apply to nearly any job without a degree that you aquire through school at a certain age, it&#39;s going to cause these people to sit on their bums and start to think ridiculous stuff and letting them brew in that dark stew for long enough to lash out physically eventually. The problem is too few jobs where learning on the job is acceptable and actually designed around this, too restrictive prerequisites for applying to these programs and too few opportunities to jump ahead from those starting positions.<br><br>How on earth are these people to act then? Be a gray silent mass? Be thankful to be denied from doing anything meaningful and be provided by the minimum to exist? People hunger for a better future, if not for themselves then for others like them, and will pursue the route that they perceive as providing that. If violence and joining gangs brings you more entertainment, food and social interactions with a meaningful task for you, then yes, people will find a way to justify that route. It should tell us in the majority that we have built too many obstacles and too hard a system for them to built a common future with us. That is not fixable by just saying &quot;but their faith&quot;. It takes long to fix and will not be easy. That&#39;s why we should have started yesterday and last year to address this.",0,0

"Tiptoeing around the issue will never solve the problem. A hundred years ago the US had a lot of poor Irish and Italians. Prohibition was passed creating a black market for alcohol. The Irish and Italians, fight knit and not very integrated at the time formed the majority of organized gangs. Eventually most of these peoples children integrated and today you don&#39;t look at an Irish or Italian and assume they are in a gang. Because they aren&#39;t. But with the rise of drugs now it&#39;s inner city kids, mostly black, as well as illegal immigrants whole run the actual war over drugs. But the problem in Sweden and elsewhere is much worse, not just poverty driven. It&#39;s driven by a religion of intolerance that is wholly incompatible with western society. Not Christian, not Jew, not Hindi, not Buddhism, Taoism, or even Pagan. Nope it&#39;s Islam, a religion with zero tolerance that seems to bend the world to it rather than integrate. Paradoxically this religion has no rights for women or LGBTQ yet it is the Western left who are it&#39;s greatest apologists. These same fools blame guns in the US.

"Damn………..There are options, but no one will like them, the reason is the ages of these kids. Here me out<br><br>Being an American who has seen this stuff for decades I can say honestly the system is broken, and evidently it’s not just the US. The biggest problem is modern kids feel like they are untouchable, that they can do no wrong, and that they can get away with anything. <br><br>It would take showing them that they are very accountable and there are severe consequences for severe crimes. In short, actions have consequences good or bad.<br><br>With that being said time to get to the point and try to keep this relatively short.<br><br>1-if the person in question is under 18 and commits a violent crime ( unaliving someone, SA, A&amp;B) then they should be tried with the sentence being what would apply as an adult. Part of that sentence being carried out in a juvenile detention center ( juvie for Americans) until they become 18 at which point the rest of the sentence if carried out in state or federal prison. If the crime would warrant the death penalty depending on the country then it’s carried out. Here in the US depending on the state it is done, otherwise they could be looking at 20-30 years in prison. <br><br>The reason for this is simple. Kids are far from dumb, they can be exceedingly manipulative and will always try to get their own way. I’ve seen it first hand working in mental health. These kids know what they do, they just don’t care. Their take on it is “so what” or “and”. It sounds horrible but it’s true.<br><br>Now it is true that when they are forced to confront their actions and the consequences like here when Simon talked about bangers having to face the victims or families of the victims that can have a profound eye opening experience. In some cases the kid will completely break down and need to be rebuilt with mental health and family support but only for those that truly realize and regret what they have done. Unfortunately more and more kids will go with manipulation rather than acceptance of what they’ve done. The result is more judges here are going with the unaliving option once the kid hits 18. <br><br>It’s not a pretty option and can’t say if it will work and it does seem heavy handed but you have to look at the victims and their families and what they’ve lost.<br><br>In closing I’ll leave this dark theory to think about, in prison when someone is SA’d it normally is for 1 of 3 reasons <br>1-they’re property <br>2-they are really not liked<br>3-it’s a statement to other inmates <br><br>In juvie it’s for 1 reason only when one kid SA another kid.<br><br>Because they can.

"Dear Simon, I think this video was not at your usual level of excellence.  It is full of anecdotal data and anti-gun statements at the begining and it is not until the end when you hit the real reasons for the violence, which are as usual mostly cultural and political.  By the way of REAL data, according with Wikipedia Sweden&#39;s homicide rate per 100 thousand people, a standard figure used to compare countries&#39; homicide rates, is 1.1 while the US rate is 6.8 and the UK is 1.2 as of 2021.  Now, there you have real data, but even that is not clear since to say 6.8 homicides in the US does NOT take into account that some states&#39; data and especially cities&#39; vary tremendously: it is just an average for a population of over 335 million people.

The difference with Europe and Sweden specifically is that we didn&#39;t tell them to come, neither treat them differently because they had lost their place, they just came and adapted because they were like if anybody else came. And you know what happened... They integrated perfectly to our society. You guys (european and usa) have some kind of fetish with telling people to come to your countries like is the best that can happen and don&#39;t take me the wrong way, i think that you have great societies and wonderful countries but when those people go you treat them like victims. Yes i know, they suffered and are kinda victim but what i mean is that you should treat them as if they were anybody else. That&#39;s mean let them be but respecting your laws and don&#39;t creat ghettos because you want to give them they space. If they come, by their own whiteout your invitation, and you let them spread like any other migrat would do is more probably that they would be more disperse and will integrate (not assimilate, is not the same) to your society.<br>I know that the venezuelans and argentines for some of you we are the same culture but we are not, we are latinos yes, as from Turkey to Scotland you are europeans so think the diversity that is there to one point to another and in between. But even in our similarities we are to complete different peoples but we can integrate. Is about no treating like a victim, if someone come they have hospitality but not necessarily we beg them to come. Think of it as a friend that comes because they lost a job or the house, you wouldn&#39;t treat them like victim without value, you will still treatment the same if they are cool is cool and if they are assoles you throw them out. <br>Thanks for taking the time to read it haha.",2,1

So the picture is a lot larger than a Swedish problem rather it is whole worn-torn middle east and underdeveloped eastern Europe problem.

When people feel rejected and have limited options they tend to lash out, especially young boys/men. Add to this the ability to earn thousands of dollars quickly, buying expensive goods and showing these off to peers, increasing their social status. <br><br>If you were in the situation of not being able to get a job, being poor and shunned from a society because of your background without good (legal) opportunities to better your life or role models, you try obtain such things in a non-legal way.

While yes we know that this is a very broad view of immigrants, and can be viewed poorly by others. We aren&#39;t doing it because we hate people, we are doing it to protect American citizens, either natural born or legal immigrants.

While at the same time deterring anyone with Ill-will towards the US, such as terrorists or people who do not value other humans like drug cartels and drug dealers, human traffickers. We know that there are times when people are trying to escape from bad guys, corrupt governments, civil wars, or foreign wars.

"So again, more proof that immigration from the Middle East is probably not the best thing for Europe. This is not a racist issue by any means. Look at all European countries that took in significant amounts of Middle Eastern immigrants. Their crime rates have gone up significantly since taking those immigrants in.<br>Yet on the other hand, look at countries, like Poland, Hungary, or even Slovenia. Their crime rates have actually decreased. And the one thing those three countries have in common is they were some of the only countries to not bring in large amounts of Middle Eastern people. So again, this is not racist at all. Middle Eastern people are absolutely amazing but when you bring people into your country through immigration , and there are not proper systems in place to help them assimilate, these are the issues you run into.",1,1

"Honestly, the statistic &quot;you&#39;re far more likely to be murdered within several blocks of your home in America than being killed in Sweden&quot; sounds disingenuous, because those were two different things you compared. Most people are murdered within a few blocks of their house. This statistic is apples and oranges when compared to the statistic of being murdered ANYWHERE in the second country (Sweden). Also, just pointing at guns being present over there doesn&#39;t mean anything, as its the weilders of the weapons that make the difference. Shotguns are allowed in many many countries, and rifles for hunting, and they dont have this problem. Across our pond, they used to have fully automatic machine guns legal until the 80&#39;s or 90&#39;s (i cant remember which) and for decades and decades, from the tommy gun all the way to M16&#39;s, there werent frequent school shootings (primarily gang/mob violence, and at least most of them refused to hurt women or children). But they banned more snd more guns, and the problem got worse each time... so the presence of a gun doesn&#39;t equate to violence, just as the presence of a gas can doesnt equate to a molotov. The wording just sounded off alarm bells. Im hoping it was just for the wording to flow smoother, and you were actually comparing relavent statistics. Also, may it be the case that the violent crime numbers for this year haven&#39;t been released yet, therefore the statistics are not accurately reflecting the violence over the last 12-18+ months? And the last variable is local officials manipulating statistics in order to reflect what they would like it to. Such as officials not too far from our area, who were found to be rapidly changing definitions, and doing everything they could, in order that the numbers were artificially deflated due to the new definitions created for political reasons. Makes it a lot easier for a politician to campaign by just showing voters a chart going down, without telling them the variables change segment to segment based on what looks better. So, the TLDR, whos honestly wielding the weapons, whos smuggling them, and how the Swedish media is spinning it, and those are just the issues that are right at the top of my head.",4,1
"Hello Swedish person here, overall accurate video. Mostly the gang members just kill eachother, but sometime there is collateral damage.

Others see it very differently, seeing the lame prison sentences and prison system here as a license to do whatever they want, be it murder, rape or whatever you can think of.

The policy change that is truly needed to quell this, is education, housing and work. Opportunities for those in poverty to get out.
