The LS 100 RGB strips don&#39;t need the Powered Hub in the box to work in a case .. you could have connected them to a Commander Pro or any other Corsair RGB hub in the case with a SATA cable for power and a USB connection for ICUE !!

"I don&#39;t believe that is the right math for the peltier.<br>Typically, peltier wattage ratings are for Qc (cooling capacity), so if this is that, you would be right to say that a 210W peltier would not be able to deal with a 300W CPU constant load.<br>But the heat dumped by the peltier would then be NOT 210W unless it happens to have a COP of exactly 1. Think of COP as an efficiency coefficient. Cheap 2-buck peltiers run at maybe 0.5+ COP best case, and very efficient new-gen ones might give you 0.75 COP with a 30+ degree delta between both sides.<br><br>But interestingly, the higher the CPU heat and the better the radiator spec, the less delta there would be and thus the larger the cooling capacity. So a CPU cooler nominally rated to 210W cooling could totally cool 300W--IF and only if the radiator side can deal with it.<br>And the higher temperature both the hot and cold sides go, the higher the delta T of the hot side to the room temperature. That means effectively you are raising the hot side beyond the usual water cooling temperatures to get even more delta to the room and get more cooling without overheating the cold side yet, which means that often, a 300W radiator can just become 500W effectively just because the water is at a higher temp than a normal loop.<br><br>That said, with all this room-warming stuff, the moment your radiator runs out of steam and can&#39;t dissipate the heat, both sides then start cooking alive with the extra heat generated and you can get thermal runaway. That&#39;s why it is always prudent to set up some sort of control logic where if the hot side is overheating, the TEC has to be shut down to prevent catastrophic damage to equipment.<br>In this case, shutting down the TEC is not an option as it is pretty much in direct contact with the CPU. You&#39;d have to emergency shut down the whole computer along with it, which makes the control logic very tricky and bad for when you don&#39;t want a malfunctioning fan hub or pump to force shut down your computer instantly.<br><br>The way I would implement TEC in a Compensator build would be to build an array with two liquid loops, hot and cold side. This way you can get thermal mass on both sides and even re-route the cold loop to a traditional rad setup that opens up if the hot side malfunctions.",1,[]

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjYUZ6Ct1ws&amp;t=7m50s"">7:50</a> - I still feel like the ideal setup for a PC Peltier (TEC) cooler is to run your loop: CPU &gt; Radiator &gt; Peltier cold-side (with it&#39;s own separate cooling loop and radiator for the hot-side) &gt; CPU.<br>That way the first radiator brings your coolant down closer to ambient, and then the Peltier cools it below ambient. The other advantage being that the Peltier never acts as an insulator and your system can still run even if it fails or can&#39;t keep up. Not sure what EK was thinking with this setup.",7,[]

"I don&#39;t believe that is the right math for the peltier.<br>Typically, peltier wattage ratings are for Qc (cooling capacity), so if this is that, you would be right to say that a 210W peltier would not be able to deal with a 300W CPU constant load.<br>But the heat dumped by the peltier would then be NOT 210W unless it happens to have a COP of exactly 1. Think of COP as an efficiency coefficient. Cheap 2-buck peltiers run at maybe 0.5+ COP best case, and very efficient new-gen ones might give you 0.75 COP with a 30+ degree delta between both sides.<br><br>But interestingly, the higher the CPU heat and the better the radiator spec, the less delta there would be and thus the larger the cooling capacity. So a CPU cooler nominally rated to 210W cooling could totally cool 300W--IF and only if the radiator side can deal with it.<br>And the higher temperature both the hot and cold sides go, the higher the delta T of the hot side to the room temperature. That means effectively you are raising the hot side beyond the usual water cooling temperatures to get even more delta to the room and get more cooling without overheating the cold side yet, which means that often, a 300W radiator can just become 500W effectively just because the water is at a higher temp than a normal loop.<br><br>That said, with all this room-warming stuff, the moment your radiator runs out of steam and can&#39;t dissipate the heat, both sides then start cooking alive with the extra heat generated and you can get thermal runaway. That&#39;s why it is always prudent to set up some sort of control logic where if the hot side is overheating, the TEC has to be shut down to prevent catastrophic damage to equipment.<br>In this case, shutting down the TEC is not an option as it is pretty much in direct contact with the CPU. You&#39;d have to emergency shut down the whole computer along with it, which makes the control logic very tricky and bad for when you don&#39;t want a malfunctioning fan hub or pump to force shut down your computer instantly.<br><br>The way I would implement TEC in a Compensator build would be to build an array with two liquid loops, hot and cold side. This way you can get thermal mass on both sides and even re-route the cold loop to a traditional rad setup that opens up if the hot side malfunctions.",1,[]

The other advantage being that the Peltier never acts as an insulator and your system can still run even if it fails or can&#39;t keep up. Not sure what EK was thinking with this setup.",7,[]

It means there&#39;s MINERAL DEPOSITS inside the water.... and you literally filled that entire custom loop with mineral water, not just your typical hard water from a tap, but actual mineral water..... literally every single piece of water cooling you just ran that crap through is effectively trash now, because we all know they&#39;re not going to flush that crap out.... such a waste ",0,[]
