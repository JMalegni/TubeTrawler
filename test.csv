Ranking the Pseudo-Legendary Pokémon Weakest to Strongest,102982,2866,306
Currently playing heart gold  and my planned team includes t-tar and dragonite. So am I basically trying to play the game on east mode?,0,0
What if i told u they r regional dragons and it just took gamefreak a little while to figure put what they wanted to do with them,1,0
Personally I&#39;d swap Baxcalibur and Dragapult  mainly because I feel like Pult&#39;s movepool is actually a bit lacking. Running a physical set is hard  because all you really have available is dragon darts and u-turn  then sucker punch which is almost useless because you already outspeed everything. And then Pult&#39;s special attack  while good  isn&#39;t amazing. What it lacks in offensive power  it more than makes up for in utility though. Baxcalibur on the other hand has all the tools it needs to succeed with using it&#39;s attack stat. Good boosting moves  an amazing ability that makes it immune to burn  some of the best offensive stab around  surprisingly good coverage for it&#39;s weaknesses  and priority if you ever even end up needing it. Theres a reason that Baxcalibur  as far as I can remember  is the only pseudo banned to ubers  and is still performing amazingly  which is a testament to how great it really is due to the massive powercreep of gen 9  with the Bikes  chi-yu  chien-pao  paradoxes  origin creations  urshifu  annhiilape  and the 2 typed Arceus all running around. Just my perspective though  in the end it all depends on what role you need filled in your team,0,0
ttar with +2 ddance  rockslide and equake one shots everything in this list,0,0
Goodra would be  at least good enough if a physical assault vest gets released.<br>Defense x1.5 but user can&#39;t use status moves or weakening certain types of moves,0,0
I think that Dragopult is the strongest Psudolegendary while Goodra is the weakest.,0,0
in all honesty  Hisuian Goodra is probably better than Metagross. I prefer Metagross as a mon  but the Dragon-Steel typing is an amazing typing both for offense and defense  couple that with it&#39;s stupidly efficient stat spread and access to moves of like 12 types  and Curse. This mon can be such a menace to society and is really hard to break sometimes if it had a healing move that isn&#39;t Rest it&#39;d be even more of a threat. <br><br>also Hydra to me is better than Mence cuz both have 4x weaknesses and ways to deal with them. Tera for Hydra is a godsend. Its just so versatile with it. Ground  Dark  Dragon  Fire  Steel  Water and Poison are all valid tera types for it. It&#39;s also an excellent Choice Scarf mon in a lot of situations. its speed is lacking but it is more of a menace than Mence most of the time.,0,0
Dissing goodra  bad list,0,0
We definitely need more none Dragon type Pseudo-Legendary Pokémon in the future games.,0,0
Mans really put Chinese knock off Mr clean headed wannabe godzilla ahead of the goats garchomp metagross and ttar,3,0
I think Metagross is this low because when it was designed  Steel type was still walling Ghost and Dark  which in Gen 6 brought Metagross from 2 weaknesses (very good) to 4 weakness (rather bad for a bulky mon)<br><br>If you ranked only Dragonite/Tyranitar/Metagross/Salamence/Garchomp/Hydreigon up to Gen 5 Metagross would be in the top3,0,0
You did my goodra dirty.  My poor happy slime dragon,0,0
Great video as always but just my two cents here  you said to make it fair so you didn&#39;t include the Mega and Z-Moves which is great but then you include the current gen gimmick the Terastalization which some of these Pokémon benefits more than the others which is what the Mega and Z-Crystal also do. If you&#39;re including the current gen gimmick  why not include the previous gen gimmick also to show the true weakest to strongest pseudo legendary? Or exclude the Terastalization gimmick as well and just go with the base only?,1,0
I will not stand for this hydreigon slander  fuck you your favorite Pokemon gets railed by furries,0,0
A little disappointed that Hisuian Goodra was not included  either as its own entry or as an addendum to Goodra itself. I’m sure that one would have ranked pretty high.,1,2

You’re good in my book long as goodra’s last,0,0
How dare you insult the great Metagross. I will defend its honor and challenge you to a DUEL!,0,0
Using my dragapult to dragon dance sweep most of the league in sword was awesome,0,0
I think metagross will rise again in this metagame,0,0
Not gonna lie  I wish dragalge was instead the pseudo  I mean typing wise already is so good  Poison Dragon  and a little bit more buff and changes in move pool and it would&#39;ve been alot better than goodra,2,0
Why are you purposefully talking so slow.,0,0
kommo-o over salamence...??,0,0
Just saying hydregion should be way more interesting and powerful then it actually is it’s a hydra that can use each of its heads can be used to enhance its ranged power has the single greatest special attack stats of the pseudo legendarys by far yet some how has less special coverage then god damn tyranitar the 4th weakest special attacker of the pseudos with only metagross garchomp and boxcaliber ( in that order) being weaker then it plus tyranitar isn’t a dragon which one of its shticks is being able to harness the elemental energy of many types yet for some reason hydregion can’t learn ice beam something that dragonnite and salamence can do are you telling me that the varietible hydra can’t do that why not give it energy ball and aura sphere With the slight smidge of rage fueled darkness after all aura sphere was commonly used by togekiss and lucario and the both of them have an aura of purity around them so by sheer contempt fueled power hydregion should be able to make an aura of its own if slightly corrupted right it is more eh hateful compared to even other pseudo legendarys,0,0
I think hisuian goodra should be a bit higher,0,0
Metagross is top 3 easily,0,1
Tbh dragon pks are carried by their stats not the dragon typing cause on its own if you think about it the dragon type is weak if the pokemon company didn&#39;t create meta where dragon stats are good you won&#39;t see it used.,0,0
psuedos,0,0
Every time I see Goodra talked about competitively it makes me sad,0,0
We need pseudos from every type,1,0
As a Dragon Trainer  it makes me so sad that the loveable derps that are Goodra and Hydreigon are so low on the list. However  Dragon-types are how I END a run. Whenever I start a new game I am a Ghost-Trainer  so I am so happy that my loveable  derpy &quot;I love my baby missiles&quot; Dragapault made the top spot.,0,0
I haven&#39;t played the newer gens  I&#39;m an old school pokemon player  but Salamance will always be the poster for Dragons and Tyrannitar will always be the King of the PokeMonsters,1,0

Dnite is definitely inflated by Tera Normal. Its performance is likely to tank in the next gen without it. I also just wish they&#39;d give Ttar Nasty Plot already  but I reckon it could be getting its crown back when part two of the DLC comes out anyway,0,0
Salamence having hydro pump is the equivalent of spitting on the opponent,1,0
I’d love a water or fairy type pseudo next,0,0
10 years and we haven&#39;t had a Fairy-Type Pseudo yet.  It&#39;d be a perfect excuse to give us a Dragon/Fairy-Type that&#39;s not permanently locked in Generation 6 forever on Mega Altaria.,1,1
I personally think in this 6v6 SV format is like this<br>1.) Baxcalibur<br>2.) Dragonite<br>3.) Dragapult<br>4.) Kommo-o<br>5.) Garchomp<br>6.) Salamence<br>7.) H - Goodra<br>8.) Hydreigon<br>9.) Tyranitar<br>10.) Metgaross<br>11.) Goodra,0,0

Nothing behind tyranitar,0,0
Hydreigon needs buff other than Terastalize lol  the stats spread are really bad,0,0
Dragapult could have been better if they  just made it a glass canon. Take 5 from each defense stat and hp. Give 10 to attack and 5 to special attack and start sweeping with them d dance sets and will o+hex,0,0

Not really sure why/how metagross is lower than tyranitar  given that metagross has the perfect type advantage to take tyranitar out  lol<br><br>Plus tyranitar has a quad weakness  lol,0,0
As someone whose second favorite Pokemon is the walking supercomputer that has psychic powers  it was painful  but not unexpected to see Metagross as low as it was. It was a ridiculously good threat in gen 6/7 ubers when mega  but sadly hasn&#39;t been amazing since. Won&#39;t stop me from using him as a skill check online when Indigo Disk releases though.,12,0
Metagross honestly sucks imo…,0,1
Goodra is best girl  but worst of the pseudos,0,1

why is it so hard for these ranking videos to say &quot;this is based on (insert format here)&quot;?,0,0
Yeah you&#39;re tripping with Metagross he has always been a beast I&#39;d put him over Kommo-o  Baxcalibur and Hydriegon,0,0
I went through most of Shield without knowing Dragapult existed  then caught a Drakloak in a raid after the eighth gym. One trip to Serebii later and it was an instant add to my then incomplete team  as I had been unable to decide on a permanent sixth member. I named her Stormfly because I couldn’t think of any undead dragons to name her after instead  and the amount of weight she pulled in the Champion Cup and on was enough to endear me to the line  even if I was dumb enough to ignore Dragon Darts. She even won me my battle with Leon  using Phantom Force to stall out his Charizard’s Gigantamax. <br><br>I haven’t used Dreepy since because it comes so late in Galar and I just haven’t yet in Paldea  but I absolutely will one of these days.,4,0
Sap Sipper Goodra next to a H-Lilligant or Meowscarada using Petal Blizzard  gives some great pressure on the enemy team. It&#39;s a tank.,0,0
I love goodra  not for its viability  just cause their so cute,0,0
I stopped watching after Metagross  one of the most decorated pokemon in VGC  being 2nd to last,0,1
I will never not use Garchomp. I consider it my signature due to my experiences with it in the battle tree. Not to mention when I go up against friends they already know I’m winning.,1,0

What’s the windwaker song in the background?<br><br>Edit: dude you’re awesome for having EVERY song you used in the description  most people don’t do that for just low volume background music! Along with the great  non biased  stat revealing and generation specific information  video  earned a fat subscribe,0,0
Dragapult is the best one imo it can 1v1 nearly all of them and win thanks to dragon darts,0,0
Running Scald and Toxic on the same guy is redundant. Also given that Salamance is a Dragonite with a better stat distribution  better abilities  and far more move options  it makes absolutely no sense for Dragonite to be higher on this list. Also you need to drop the T-Tar prejudice  it was almost amazing but never was as good as this channel makes him out to be  seeing as the most common types offensively always crushed it; he was never at the level that Garchomp  Salamence and Metagross were at. I always forget every time I come back to this channel to catch up that the videos are top tier  but always act off too much bias and ideallic theory that doesn&#39;t consider that you can&#39;t have all of these things at once and/or history shows it not to be true.,1,0
Funny that Goodra has no mega form when they introduced Mega evo and Fairy typing on the same gen where it was first introduced.  It would&#39;ve been better if they at least gave it a dual typing (Fairy/Dragon or Poison/Dragon) so it could stand out even without Mega.,0,0
Well. Hydreigon can learn flash cannon.,0,0
I don&#39;t get why the Eeveelution lines are referred to as dogs. Their designs take way more from cats and rabbits than dogs.<br>Espeon is a literal bakeneko.,0,0
Ttar is crap in UU. It&#39;s RU. Hisuian goodra is a good UU Mon. Kommo o is uubl.,0,0
I ran an Assault Vest Goodra which is basically immortal against special attacks because of it;s natural high spd. Basically  any special attacking fairy type will lose to Goodra running Sludge Wave. Also ran the Gooey ability which slows down the speed of mons who hit it with physical attacks. Goodra has both respectable HP and Special attack with great coverage and decent speed. Not so sure about it being at the bottom of this list... I&#39;ve even beat Garchomp with it 1 v 1 (ones that don&#39;t run Outrage) at times.,14,1

It was too much to deny Shadow Claw to Dragapult; i cam understand Poltergeist  the same reason they didn&#39;t give that move to Aegislash  or Heavy Slam to Metagross  Dragon Dance to Garchomp  Moonblast to Togekiss  to prevent it being OP  but this is ridiculous.,0,0
Being ranked low among kings/queens  hey you&#39;re still royalty!,0,0
i use to run goodra in competitive with sludge wave or bomb (dont remember) dragon pulse thunderbold and flamethrower i believe keeping its stats kinda mid defense wise expect high hp and it did the  job well,1,0
It&#39;s sad to see both Garchomp and Metagross low in this list. But I&#39;m happy that Baxcalibur is that high since it honestly grew on me after a couple months of SV.,55,5
They keep making dragons…and making the fairy type stronger and stronger,0,0
What&#39;s a great move set for a timid Tyranitar in generation 3 that appears to have good stats in special defense? and EV spread would really appreciate the help for competitive play<br>.,1,0
My heart wants to scream at you  tell you Garchomp is best. Hell  look at its pre-evo. Gible deserves it  just for that face. But in my mind… I know it’s Dragapult…,0,0
It really hurt seeing Metagross ending up so low,1,1
I think Fairy needs to be nerfed tbh,2,0
Baxcalibur wrecks omg! Absolutely love using it!!,1,0
I understand why most pseudo pokemon are dragon  but at least don&#39;t do that when the legendary is also dragon type. Like gen 9 should have switched it up. Gen 5 as well.,0,0

Tyranitar the GOAT.,0,0
Can you strongest non legendary including pseudos,0,0
i wish they took 5 points of salamence&#39;s attack to put in speed,0,0
Must admit i have personally had nothing but problems with my (several) dragonite&#39;s  and if komo-o doesnt have its gimmick (terra or z-crystal) then I dont think its really better than metagross or hydeigon. if mega&#39;s were still a thing i know metagross would be above komo-o. speaking from my experiences i can say that Garchomp  Metagross and Salamence are always consistant and worthy choices  whereas <b>most</b> of the other pseudo&#39;s have to fill a particular role ie. sandstream. i havent played much with dragapult or baxcalibur so forgive my knowledge there,1,2
GameFreak really needs to stop making Dragon-types.  They&#39;re completely useless now with Fairy-types being a thing.,1,3
My boi Metagross better not be listed on the weaker end or I might make a nerdass YouTube comment about it<br><br><br>Edit: NOOOOOOOO,0,4
Dragonite will always be my #1,1,0
I prefer ttar over garchomp only because I grew up with gen 1+2 but that with flygon is amazing,0,0
I think Dragonite might be the only pseudo legendary that I have actually used and raised it to level 100 and that was only recently. The others were sort of on my post game teams,5,2
Hydreigon will always be my favorite next to tyranitar.,0,0
I’m not sure who’s my favorite pseudo legendary. It’s gotta be either Dragonite or Tyranitar.,0,2
Personally  I think Salamence should have been higher ranked  but I&#39;d somewhat agree with the rest,22,0
Can’t wait for best team with no restrictions after the indigo disk comes out!,0,0
I think Goodra just needed the water typeing   little extra love and I bet you that would have made a difference . Maybe 10 less base attack for 10 more special to really get crazy but at least have that second typing,38,5
Been using Goodra for the hisuian typhlosion Tera raid… have farmed it 15x times now and still haven’t fainted once,2,0
This might make a good short: so you think Sabrina will still be the strongest Kanto leader in a potential remake that includes Annihilape?,2,0
Don’t forget that dragapault is one of the best Pokemon designs. Period.,5,2
Baxcalibur is awesome I used it on my main Scarlet team and its got an awesome design and typing by far the best Pseudo Legendary we have had it years and my favourite of all Pseudo Legendaries,4,1
I agree but they should make other puesdo legendaries that are not dragon type.,1,0
This ranking is &quot;fine&quot;. I do disagree where Dragapult is. But when are we ever gonna get a Poison  Electric  Normal  Grass  or Fire pseudo? We get it GameFreak  Dragons are powerful. But try something new!,1,2
I am still sad Haxorus isn&#39;t part of the club  I always find myself using him over Garchomp,2,0

Hey Mystic  I enjoyed your video.<br><br>I do have one question for you and anyone who wants to answer:<br><br>If you could design your own pseudo-legendary  what would it be in terms of type and what would its stats be?,3,4
Are these lists generally designed for competitive puproses  the single player game  or a combination of both?,0,3
Honestly when Legends Arceus came out  I wanted to see a past regional variant of Dragapult that is Dragon/Water Type since the Dreepy Dex entries always mention how when it was alive it chilled in deep ancient seas and even how its old behaviors and habits come back as vestiges. As for the next Pseudo Legendary  I have a few ideas of what I would want and what I could see GameFreak doing. I can see them making a Dragon/Psychic Pseudo because they both used to be the OP types of back in the day so they might pay homage to it since it is the 10th Generation. I could also see them doing something crazy like Dragon/Fairy since it&#39;s a typing that feels special in a way like it is chaotic and feels like they shouldn&#39;t go together like Fire/Ice and Ghost/Normal. Another thing they might do to sort of troll is give us a Dragon/Normal Pseudo and the reason I can see this is so that they can give an excuse to give them a move of every type  so like a jack of all trades Pseudo Legendary if that makes sense. The last one is what I would want and that would be like a pick your path Pseudo Legendary  to be more specific be able to pick between Fire  Water  and Grass types. So  it would be the same Pokémon  but you just choose to evolve it a certain way to have the type you want. Maybe through the evolution stones  and I don&#39;t wanna hear any &quot;bUt ThEn iT wOuLdN&#39;t Be A pSeuDO-&quot; like I know  I&#39;m just saying it as an example. In the same idea I could see them making Dragon/Electric using the Thunder Stone  but it could also work as its own separate idea since Electric is a special typing  being that it is the type of Pokémon&#39;s mascot and all. Other than that  I guess they could appease fans and give us Bug/Dragon  but I wouldn&#39;t want the Pseudo Legendary to have that type personally. And of course  they could throw a curve ball and just not have a Dragon Type Pseudo again  but yea those are my thoughts. Anyone else have ideas they&#39;d like to share; I mostly just mentioned types and not any concepts so perhaps you can give a concept to one of the ideas for the types I gave.,33,4
As good as Dragapult &amp; Salamance are in Pokémon battles in general  why are most pusedo legendary Pokémon have the dragon typing? I’m curious on when we’re gonna get more psuedo legendary Pokémon without having the dragon type?,1,2
