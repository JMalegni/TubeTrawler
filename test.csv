Ofcourse I know an Octopus can do an underwater maze  but I&#39;m still going to tap on the video. Also an Overwater maze might be more unexpected.,1,0

Some friends and I were scuba diving in Mexico and they found a curious octopus.  It was swimming between people quite playfully.  What they  didnt know there was a stone fish well camoflaged sitting on the bottom between them and Stone fish like to eat octopus.  As the octopus swam between them the stone fish lept of the bottom and ate the octopus.  The divers were horrified since they were responsible for the octopus death.  Happily  the stonefish settled to the bottom and the octopus managed to squeeze out of the stone fishes gills and to safety.  Clever octopus!,2,0
Just look at the amount of views,0,0
if you&#39;ve thought of the question then &quot;No&quot; you cannot feed a brooding female octopus. Simply because she won&#39;t see it as food anymore  she will instead see it as a form of &quot;contamination&quot; or &quot;danger&quot; to her young.,0,0
First person to say octopus without the pus wins 1 000 dollars,0,0
I eat entire octopus but I feel like octopus are very cool from how smart they are,0,0
Of octopi didnt live for such a long time they would tottally become the first intelligent species way before humans. Their life span is natures way of balancing this overpowered class,0,0
I don&#39;t know how you could give her up. That&#39;s like giving your dog back.,0,0
Octopus&#39; are far smarter than humans  they have brains all over their bodies. It&#39;s sad to see them chopped up and eaten as well as their coral reefs (their homes) being destroyed. I wish i could just ship them to a kind world without humans so that they can live peacefully...,0,0
I Love how she chose the Squidward house  because she&#39;s a squid. I love that ,0,0

I saw an octopus try an overwater maze. Didn&#39;t go well,0,0
Mark Robers hot!?,0,0
Hmmmm. I wonder if she is really happier being released where she has a significantly higher chance of being eaten and significantly harder time finding food. Maybe she wonders why she was abandoned. <br><br>Or  perhaps  she doesn&#39;t feel anything at all.,0,0
Hey bro why did you leave me?,0,0
It is quite astounding how intelligent octopuses (octopi?) are given their short lifespan. Is it possible their intelligence is passed  somehow  from one generation to the next?,0,0
El bicho se encariña contigo y luego lo abandonas en el hostil mundo salvaje. Pésimo servicio ,0,0
I suggest installing a camera exactly on the spot where you let her go so we can see if she comes back to wait for you. I think for sure she will at some point and it makes me sad that you won&#39;t be there for her.,0,0

They&#39;re just like aliens in this evolutionary table  but they share the same DNA just like all the other living creatures on Earth. This makes us come to the conclusion that life may be present everywhere in the Universe.,0,0
I heard about a theory because no other animal is like an octopus that an asteroid hit earth with a little life on it and that turned into an octopus and therefore part alien :),0,0

I’m really sorry to say  that sushimi is definitely dead. You don’t just put an animal raised without learning to hunt  straight into a harsh environment and expect them to survive.

I’m certain that octopus could develop societies and cultures if their lives weren’t so short  as if they were longer  they could pass knowledge down to the next generation. But this does get rid of the octopus’s best survival ability  which is to adapt super quickly. Like jellyfish and sea spiders  the octopus will actually benefit from climate change  as competition may go extinct  leading to the octopus taking more ecological niches. Perhaps a social octopus or longer living octopus could develop over millions of years… I’m actually going to write a book about that lmao,2,0

Wonderful video.  A lot of their on-the-spot problem solving is driven by their extraordinary  Intuition.  In the wild  octopuses ( and fyi..octopi” is not the correct plural.)   would never encounter their prey in a sealed jar.  But they are so exploratory-driven to intuit a solution thru trial and error.  Their intelligence vs human intelligence is the best example of convergent evolution.  And I cannot imagine what would happen to this intelligence if they evolved into creatures that have longer lives.  Thank so much,0,0

Excellent video - however I have be a pedant and correct you on &#39;Octopi&#39;. It&#39;s just wrong.

I want to put my whole perspective on the alien thing. You&#39;re looking at something completely different  instead of the common mammal which supports life  the 7 vertebrae and hands proportions shape  and when people say they saw aliens  they were bipedal human looking people  so I think we&#39;re not looking straightly enough.,0,0

Super cool video! One complaint is the use of octopi... The word octopus has Greek origins. Therefore  the use of &quot;i&quot; to make it plural  as in Latin  is incorrect. It should be octopodes. It is also correct to say &quot;octopuses&quot; since the English language borrows words from other origins. It is grammatically correct to simply plural octopus with &quot;es&quot;.<br><br>Seriously though  I love what you did and happy you were able to release that amazing creature back into the wild.,0,0

It would have been cooler if you actually kept her  y&#39;know as your pet  and not turn her into ocean feed. When you remind us how short their lives are  it makes even less sense to release her when you did. Imagine if more people released their pets into the wild the moment they felt guilty about ownership. Cool stuff with the mazes  but really bad rationale with the rest of it. I&#39;d say you missed the Mark here big time. RIP Sashimi.,6,0

One thing we never see is one animal kind changing into another. Darwin was worried when he didn&#39;t find it in the fossil layers and we still have not one shred of evidence for it today. What we do see is adaptation within a kind. In fact  it happens way faster than evolution gives room for. Evolution is theory on it&#39;s last crumbling leg.,2,0
It occurs to me that if octopi ever actually develop aquaculture and communities their reproduction rate will be simply insane. Because the males shut down after mating  but the female starve. If they have food given to them  the females can mate multiple times with different mates.,0,0

Romanticizing owning an octopus as a pet while attempting to highlight how intelligent they are is thick with irony and not very responsible.

Honestly probably one of the biggest factors why there isnt an entire under water civilization of Octopi<br>Because their lifespawn is to short to share their gained inteligence to the offspring<br><br>Longer Lifespawn is needed to teach and train which doesnt work when the parrent dies close after the offspring are fully grown and able to fend for themselves.<br>Its what seperates humans from the Octopi.<br><br>Tho who knows maybe eventually Octopi evolve with longer lifespawns and perhaps this changes?,0,0

Hey Mark  instead of always quoting short lapses of time in milliseconds  why not in seconds?

Love this obstacle course  and a showcase of how incredibly intelligent the octopus is! What fascinating creatures!<br><br>I must say  as a linguistics enthusiast  that the plural of octopus is actually octopuses or octopodes. Octopi is technically a non-standard pluralization because octopus is of Greek origin  and using -i to pluralize is only for words of Latin origin  and if you&#39;re going to follow the prescriptive grammar rules of pluralization  you can&#39;t combine Greek and Latin bits together. <br><br>But at the same time  language is simply a way of effectively transmitting a message. The message was completely understood on my part  and for me to go on a further diatribe about your choice of pluralization would be just me being a prick. ,9,0

My opinion is that if humans save and protect the Earth  these octopuses will start to land on land and they will become the second intelligent life form on Earth after humans. This creature has great potential  they need to find a way to extend their short lifespan  and with each new generation  they will become a little more intelligent than their previous octopus ancestors. We know they have a lot of neurons  the same thing in humans  and that took us to space  maybe in the future octopians will display our fossils.,0,0

Have you ever thought that Octopus are aliens that ended up on our planet to study our oceans. They don’t live long in the wild… 2-5 years… maybe our planet is a bit hostile to them…. We aren’t sure how they communicate with each other… they can change shape  color  and texture… maybe they got here via panspermia… our own species are more focused on space than our own oceans…. Maybe they hypothesize something we haven’t…. And the only fauna with triple helix DNA….. there is something remarkable about these cephalopods…. And I’m not sure that they are of this earth,0,0

Common descent evolution is a total myth. Firstly  the DNA comparisons (called phylogenetic anaylses)  checking the back of the book as Mark put it  contradict the idea that anatomical similarities equate to relatedness. Literally every single solitary phylogenetic analysis ever conducted has produced incongruities in the anatomically and genetically inferred trees. Yes  literally every single one!! Furthermore  there are countless evidences that contradict common descent theory  but the most significant is that the network of genes which determine the type of animal that is made during embryological development (called a developmental gene regulatory network) are immutable apart from death or total inviability. This means no animal can evolve beyond its own kind just as is stated in the Bible.,1,0

While I understand your impulse to return your octopus to the wild  in all honesty octopi don’t have a really great life in the wild.  A female octopus gets bred  starves herself while she guards her eggs for however long it takes for them to hatch  and dies.  A male octopus usually dies as soon as he’s mated.  The fact that they generally don’t survive procreation is probably a large part of why they haven’t taken over the world.,1,0

I read the breeding reason is why their intelligence doesn’t grow beyond what it is. Where as humans pool learnt knowledge. Octopi essentially hard reset after breeding. The parents can’t pass on their knowledge. Imagine if they could. They’d be top of the chain and not us. I suppose that’s evolution for you without necessity they haven’t needed to evolve that trait “yet”,1,0

This may sound weird but they have to be artistic to some point in order to look at a Surface  gain all of the details and information and then color change to its exact texture  tone  shades  etc. in other words  they can record any surface and replicate it nearly instantaneously like a master of replicating. <br>I’ve always known they can color change and camouflage but the fact how fast they can do it is amazing to me. <br>Which creature/animal can camouflage the quickest on a new terrain or new surface? That’s truly seems like an amazing experiment to me as it can teach a lot about different creatures that “can camouflage”  “how fast they can camouflage”  “how fast they can replicate a surface  texture  shades  tones  etc.”  “what makes them camouflage” and also “what impacts the speed of camouflaging”. <br>You’re turning me into a nerd Mark Rober and I love it! <br><br><br>@MarkRober,2,0

How hard is the change in water parameters on that octopus (when it got released into the ocean)? I only know from having fresh water fish  that slowly acclimating them to the new environment is very important as not to shock their system.

How in the world are you equating solving a bunch of arbitrary  completely artificial puzzles to surviving in the wild? I guarantee you bought the octopus completely aware of how smart they are and that they&#39;re not bred in captivity. You supported the industry that captures these creatures  poked and prodded at it for a few months until you were bored  got some Youtube content out of it and then chucked it back into the ocean to fend for itself with zero prior experience feeding itself  evading predators  etc. What is wrong with you??????,0,0

Actually showing the scientific steps required.<br><br>In my opinion now  evolution is a religion. <br><br>- 2nd E.g. <br>What is the fastest animal to reproduce? Do you see changes in an amoeba  changing to a different kind of animal? Or do amoebas turn into amoebas? <br>Can a human  bat  chicken or dolphin ever produce anything but themselves? <br>Humans always produce humans.<br>Bats always produce bats.<br>Chickens always produce chickens.<br>&amp; Dolphins always produce dolphins. <br><br>Anyone out there can see differently  besides just drawing lines on paper  I would like to see it.<br><br>Thanks,0,0

I&#39;d like to think in those really brief moments where they swim up and touch humans  it&#39;s like they&#39;re having days long conversations just from simple touch and taste and smell. And idk. Thinking about this just makes me reflect on how we can stretch out our perception of time just by noticing and appreciating all the things around us similar to the octopus.,690,12

After this clip  people flocked to grab sashimi. Haha,0,0
Equating the solving of a cognitive puzzle to the ability to survive in the wild is quite a  uh  well  mental gymnastics. Yes  smarts account for a lot in survival but it&#39;s also relevant smarts. How to engage with a particular type of prey  how to identify and avoid predators   among other things. And while octopus like Sashimi isn&#39;t domesticated and still have innate survival instincts  it still requires reinforcement during its upbringing.,0,2

I’m actually surprised I haven’t seen anyone mention this. There are so many diseases and parasites in the pet trade. They can be picked up easily by feeding store bought food. This can obviously be a problem when the octopus is released into the wild and potentially spread non native disease/ parasites. Honestly very surprised mark didn’t think of this. Please never release a pet into the wild. No matter how long youve had it  even if it was originally wild caught,1,0

The weirdest  or at least most counter intuitive fact about cephalopods is that they <i>appear</i> to be colour blind  they have only one type of photoreceptor ... which is veeeery confusing for a creature so adept at camouflage. As far as Im aware they are still not entirely sure how this works  though one of the possible mechanisms is that they focus only on parts of the spectrum  so all other colours would be blurry. (Chromatic Abberation) By sweeping through what comes in to focus they can construct the colours  though in a way that is completely alien to our own vision.<br>This may also be why they have such strange pupils as it optimises this method of seeing. (I believe it also works well in low light which may be why they evolved this way instead of having more receptors like most other life.),0,0

So many of them are deposited into the ocean  statistically she could have been eaten as a small speck. Personally I think she would have been better off in a home without predators. For all you know  she got eaten as soon as she was dropped into the ocean. So statistically it is more humane to keep her than to release her. Just saying.,0,0

i remember hearing about a theory which stated  that if humans hadn&#39;t become the dominant species on earth  octopi would have. and as you pointed out their natural curiosity  i could see why. we owe a lot of our progress to our curiosity  so it makes a lot of sense that another species with such an inherent curiosity and the means to apply and express it would have been extremely successful.,1,1

I love the beginning of the tree of life chart.  But they leave off the side note that the probability of even one  just one  simple protein molecule forming by chance in this organic soup is 1 x 10 to the 113th power!   That number is larger than all the atoms estimated to be in the universe.  So suffice it to say ~ not likely.  And that does not bode well for the rest of the tree chart.,1,0

Mark  why are you like this just let them eat. ,0,0
Before returning her you need to offer her live food to hunt. Like native things she&#39;d be able to find. Otherwise she may starve before figuring out how to hunt in the wild,2,0

Octopuses are amazing and wonderful and interesting  but they don&#39;t really make the best pets. They&#39;re fragile and short-lived and usually wild-caught. So they have a special place in my heart  but I won&#39;t force them into my home.,1,0

There’s no way you named her sushimi ,1,0

I cannot believe that you challenged the cosmic knowledge of our cephalopod overloads,0,0
I dont think this octopus got frustrated when it sat there at the ball drop. It most likely got a &quot;Ohhhh. So that&#39;s how this is&quot;.<br><br>But octopus problem solving skill is just far too advance. We can even argue that it might be better than that of a human at some point.,0,0
After this video  I feel octopus have become my new favourite pets after cats and dogs. They&#39;re just so wholesome and this video paints their nature and behaviour in a whole different light. Kudos to you Mark!,2,0

Great Video!<br><br>When talking about the similarities of the arm bone structure of a bat  humans  chickens and dolphins. He was saying it pointed to a same ancestor. Although you could use this to help the evolution theory don&#39;t discount that this can also help point to one creator who uses the same efficient formula in many creatures.

The thoughtfulness of the obstacles re what he researched of their capabilities was impressive.  More so was the “I let her slide” when she got creative at the end of the maze.  Because  let’s be real  there ain’t no rules in the wild - you figure it out  or you’re dead.  So yeah  she gets the hall pass of real life.,0,0

I&#39;m a little disappointed that you called them octopi the entire video and never pointed out that  even though accepted by most  adding an &quot;i&quot; to the end of a word is Latin  but octopus is a Greek word  so the plural would be octopuses. Another fun fact; the Greek plural for the word is octopodes  which is just really fun to say.,0,0

Hey I know you probably wanted a heart warming ending to the video  but did you talk to anyone before releasing your octopus? It&#39;s illegal in most places to release animal kept as pets. Even if you believe she can survive  release her can have adverse affects on the environment. For example  it&#39;s very likely that while at the aquarium store  she came into contact with multiple new illnesses  which she may now introduce to the part of the ocean where you returned her  which could infect octopi with lesser immune systems  having the opposite effect on the population that you intend. Also  I think in general encouraging people to release any kind of pet into the wild is a bad idea.,1,0

I don&#39;t think people recognize the intelligence of the octopus by watching it solve puzzles that seem very simple and obvious to us. However  we need to remember that the octopus has never seen a button or a lever before; unlike us. So having the ability to figure out what each thing does in such a short time is extremely impressive. Think of this like putting a human in a room with alien technology.,1,0

Wow  just when I thought you couldn&#39;t outdo yourself.  Way to go Mark. You really are one great human. Hope your son got a chance to enteract with your octopus. That was most entertaining and informative video I&#39;ve ever seen. Thanks you!,75,0

i took care of the baby octopus in my high school biology lab. i fell in love with this amazingly intelligent being. it loved to play. we discovered many things about one another. my teacher kept trying to get me to not get attatched by playing with it.....i never listened to that one direction. how could you have something that smart  that young  and not interact with it?  <br>their life is short. so does time pass differently for them? what worries me is since they have been in an environment where there are no predators for what could be years to them.....are they missing a paranoid stay away from this presence if they are released back to where they are from? <br>mark  there are no mazes i have ever seen in the ocean and octopi dont hunt dead things.<br>how long did you spend at the ocean after its release? have you been back to check? they do form bonds with himans. <br>i will never forget my eight armed friend  it was a privilege.,1,0

Also have you thought about doing specialised boxes for certain topics in science? Like how to build a newtons cradle or simple safe chemistry kits like those from Mel science.

Know that we did not evolve  it&#39;s a Just So story like &quot;How the elephant got his trunk.&quot; There&#39;s no scientific evidence for it as it&#39;s an exercise of arranging different types of cutlery. In fact  on the evidence side  it&#39;s literally impossible for a cell to form from random atomic motion. As for natural selection  the variety comes from genes not mutations. Genomes are all being broken down by mutations  which is why it&#39;s now risky to marry a cousin when hundreds of years ago it was fine - because the chances of you both having damage to the same gene are now much higher.,0,0

HO HO HO RED GIANT!<br>do red giant stars change into white dwarf stars over millions of years?; Sirius is an example of a red star becoming white within the past 2 000 years. Ancient astronomers recorded that Sirius glowed red in the sky  yet now it is categorized as white. Sooooo opinions of the length of time to change are giant star into a white dwarf star are incorrect.,1,0

The reason why octopuses are not as advanced as us even though they are very intelligent  comes down to the fact that they don’t live even a fraction of how long we live. 80 years (give or take a decade depending on time) is a long time to gain knowledge of your surroundings and figure out everything we have figured out how to do.,0,0

What if octopuses can collect remember and transfer data from generation to generation just like us. Then  Sashimi will tell everything she learnt about humans and solving puzzles to her kids who will then go on more expeditions to collect more data and eventually will gather enough data and acquire enough intelligence over the years to finally over through us humans.

Uh oh. You said octopi. &quot;Octopi&quot; is often used as a plural form of &quot;octopus &quot; but it&#39;s not technically correct.

Scientific until the evolution. If all life came from the ocean shouldn&#39;t the silt be deeper? Some quick math of how much is deposited each year and we can determine the age of the earth from the silt  no? It isn&#39;t billions of years ... unless there was no decomposition  which also isn&#39;t scientific. Also where is a single missing link between anything and anything else? I mean full skeletons. Millions of years between and we have fossils on either side but not the middle. Where are they?  Until that&#39;s discovered evolution is just an idiotic (anti-religious  tribalist) theory.,0,0

A hand fed creature of any kind should not be released back to wild they will be to trusting and approach predators not knowing any better thinking it’s safe like when dealing with you or other humans who they would normally be cautious of or avoid in wild <br>They become to trusting after being handled for so long <br>I like your videos but I really disagree with this <br>Once captured and handled no wild animal should not be returned to wild <br>Basically a death sentence,2,0

I lived in Thailand for over six years  where you can find blue ring octopus in aquatic-themed pet stores. The first thing I noticed was the huge blue ring on his side. He&#39;s obviously got some of the blue ring octopus genes in him.

some fun facts about octopuses:<br><br>1. <b>*Flexible Bodies:*</b> Octopuses are incredibly flexible and can squeeze through tight spaces  thanks to their lack of bones.<br><br>2. <b>*Smart Invertebrates:*</b> They are considered highly intelligent among invertebrates  with problem-solving skills and the ability to learn through observation.<br><br>3. <b>*Camouflage Masters:*</b> Octopuses are skilled at camouflage and can change both the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings.<br><br>4. <b>*Three Hearts:*</b> They have three hearts – two pump blood to the gills  and one pumps it to the rest of the body.<br><br>5. <b>*Short Lifespan:*</b> Despite their intelligence  octopuses have relatively short lifespans. Many species only live for a few years.<br><br>6. <b>*Jet Propulsion:*</b> Octopuses can use a jet of water to propel themselves forward  allowing for quick escapes from predators or pursuits of prey.<br><br>7. <b>*Nocturnal Creatures:*</b> Most octopuses are nocturnal  meaning they are more active during the night.<br><br>8. <b>*Beak and Venom:*</b> They have a sharp beak that they use to open shellfish  and some species also have venomous saliva to subdue their prey.<br><br>9. <b>*Exceptional Problem Solvers:*</b> Octopuses have been known to escape from enclosures  open jars to obtain food  and even dismantle equipment in aquariums.<br><br>10. <b>*Mating Rituals:*</b> After mating  the female octopus lays thousands of eggs and guards them until they hatch. The female usually dies shortly after the eggs hatch.,0,0

So you domesticated a octopus as a pet and then abandoned it in the ocean??? That is like taking in a dog and after it is grown abandoning next to the highway.

I would love to come out to Crunch Labs someday and meet you  Mark Rober. Ever since I was 7 I have wanted to become an engineer just like you and you inspire me so much and my dream is to do some crazy build with you someday I am still learning and I haven&#39;t even reached the tip of engineering yet I have still have so much more to learn. but my family is not that wealthy and can&#39;t afford my desired needs and equipment to build stuff. You also live across the United States from me so I will probably never get to meet you but I at least want to get to talk to you someday. And even though I am 12 I know a lot about engineering and Computer science and have been coding for the past 2 years and there is a chance that you probably will never read this but if you do Mark Rober Thank you and I want to let you know that you inspire me so much and that I could hopefully meet you someday. :) (thank you for entertaining me and inspiring me),1,0
