# TubeTrawler
This is the final project for group 75 in Data Structures and Algorithm at the University of Florida for Fall 2023. Our goal is to take two data structures, fill them with comments from any YouTube video, and use the structures in a meaningful way so that we can measure the comparative effectiveness of each structure.
