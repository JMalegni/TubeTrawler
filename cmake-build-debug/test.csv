"This game is so entertaining and one of the best things I&#39;ve played in 2023, I cannot recommend it enough. I&#39;ve seen very few people talk about this game which is a genuine shame. The variety of mechanics and gameplay styles easily put this game as innovative as the likes of INSIDE, but with a much more lighthearted tone. It has an amazing voice acting cast as well, starring Yuri Lowenthal (Spiderman 1 &amp; 2), Krizia Bajos (Cyberpunk, League of Legends) and Cissy Jones (Firewatch!!). The game is genuinely great and I recommend trying it for yourself if you enjoy this video",448,"['', 'easily my favourite game this year', 'Loved your playthrough of it, its a refreshing take on Dosney Corporation Epcot Failure', 'I knew he sounded familiar!, I managed to link to to Ben 10, even though I’ve played spiderman 2 more recently and knew they had the same voice actor, but hey ho', 'this is why i love RT! always so passionate about everything he plays, i love it! also as an aspiring va and someone who just loves seeing my favorite voice actors in other things, loving the va appreciation! yuri lowenthal is THE GOAT!']"

"Reminder: this isnt just fantastical. Walt Disney the real human person wanted to make epcot a real city, where appliances and homes would be regularly renovated and updated with prototypes of the latest products from their sponsors. It was for all intensive purposes supposed to be a company town, where anyone unable to work would be evicted, but the residents would also have to serve double duty as entertainers as the true main source of revenue would be tourism from the people visiting both epcot and disney world. The only reason epcot didnt end up a city was because Walt Disney died before he could see it through, and pretty much all of his buisness associates saw the problems with trying to run a city like that",0,[]

"Huh, this game was a massive disappointment. While the basic premise is interesting for a game it&#39;s honestly not done very well. Game is too basic to be interesting and the plot is just a worst Truman Show with modern meta commentary sprinkled in. The only thing I honestly like about this game is the dialogue and even that is rough in a lot of place. The main attraction is meant to be the plot but it&#39;s too familiar to me to enjoy and it relies too heavily on it&#39;s premise and meta nature. Having interesting or good ideas doesn&#39;t mean a story is itself good or interesting, it needs to be able to express itself well and tell an enjoyable experience. And the game just doesn&#39;t do that, it&#39;s a problem I&#39;m seeing more and more lately where people substitute actual storytelling with an interesting premise and high profile actors.",0,[]

"Spoilers below<br>. <br>. <br>. <br>. <br>. <br>That people were divided on the ending in this particular case imo is a good thing as it matches the unjust nature of immoral governments ane corporations irl, as well as the tragically short attention span sometimes of even those who want change with a callout to performative activists in a capitalist and consumerist world. <br><br>The most meaningful gesture by Trevor beside trying to shut it all down, was telling millions (and Vivian) to fuck off and it was reduced to merchandise and probably marketing for future seasons of Escape from Arcadia. Kendra even monetized Angela betraying Walton media. A few called out the fact that Trevor and Angela themselves were watching Steve&#39;s run in the post credits, which is a fair point. I think they&#39;re also keeping track of what human rights they&#39;re violating now, but at least pirate it guys! <br><br>Not to say idealistic endings don&#39;t have their place, life is tough as is. But I really liked this, it leaves you to think about how we can make our real world better, at the least, yourself. Also as someone on the Discord told me the ending is so fitting for Trevor just wanting a quiet life rather than being a revolutionary (even if I imagine he will become a figure for it in time). <br><br>And lastly, Don&#39;t Be a Fool is such a bop my god.
